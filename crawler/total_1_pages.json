        "content": "singapore national service's golden jubilee was commemorated in 2017 since the national service amendment bill was passed on march 14 1967 more than 900 000 male singaporeans have served ns a key pillar of defence but the rite of passage for men here continues to evolve the straits times reviews four key areas that have drawn attention training safety in the singapore armed forces came under closer scrutiny with the high profile death of actor aloysius pang in january 2019 the operationally ready national serviceman was on a live firing exercise in new zealand when he suffered serious crush injuries while operating a singapore self propelled howitzer this came after full time national servicemen dave lee and liu kai died in 2018 in separate incidents and third sergeant gavin chan hiang cheng died in exercise wallaby in australia in 2017 since mr pang's death a top level inspector general's office was set up to improve safety at all levels of the saf through efforts such as doing audits and assessing the safety culture at units with the aim of achieving zero training fatalities no training or operations related death has been reported since then dr samuel chan a former associate research fellow from the military studies programme at the s rajaratnam school of international studies rsis said that training safety is care for soldiers one of the saf's core values in action but this does not mean easier or lax standards it is about removing the peripheral risks and managing the inherent risks in meeting training objectives training imbues personnel with the confidence to address similar risks during operations this is why the saf takes training seriously and its safety record is crucial in securing society's commitment to defence in terms of ns participation and the recruitment and retention of regulars singapore born best selling writer kevin kwan was involved in controversy when it was revealed in august 2018 that he defaulted on his ns in 1990 the crazy rich asians author based in the united states applied and appealed to renounce his singapore citizenship without serving ns but this was rejected in 1994 an average of about 350 people default on their ns requirements each year said defence minister ng eng hen in a parliamentary reply in 2018 they either failed to register or enlist for ns a sentencing framework by the high court in 2017 introduced four tiers of punishment based on the length of the default period the written judgment noted that the principles affecting ns are national security universality where all those who are fit to serve must do so and equity everyone must be treated the same way regardless of background or status this was spelt out by then minister for defence teo chee hean in a ministerial statement in parliament in 2006 since the framework was introduced 18 defaulters have been sentenced lawyer laurence goh said the introduction of the framework has given more certainty to those deciding whether to return to singapore or remain on the run abroad the structured tier system allows those intending to come back the possibility to plan their life in singapore or their future outside singapore after facing the music including serving full time if they are still eligible to do so he added for those no longer liable for full time service it gives them a sign of relief that there is certainty in the punishment they can expect and their ordeal can finally be over the issue of whether sportsmen should be given deferments to allow them to pursue their careers sparked national debate in august 2018 when footballer benjamin davis then 17 had his request to defer ns denied he was the first singaporean to sign professional terms with an english premier league epl club fulham he became a defaulter in february 2019 when he failed to enlist in a 2018 parliament speech setting out the reasons for his ministry's decision dr ng said to grant deferment to mr ben davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their ns dutifully as required and not at a time of their choosing only three sportsmen have been granted long term deferments in the last 15 years sailor maximilian soh and swimmers joseph schooling and quah zheng wen to allow them to take part in the olympics all three have since enlisted footballer harry birtwistle who signed for another epl club wolverhampton wanderers in october last year has failed to register for ns singapore management university associate professor of law eugene tan said ns serves a critical need for national security for a young nation state and the exceptional nature of long term deferment requires the process to be highly selective and stringent this ensures that the fundamental principles of universality and equity which undergird ns are given effect to if the onerous criteria are not adhered to the morale and commitment to ns and the defence of singapore would be severely weakened he added the fact that only three sportsmen have secured long term deferment in the past 15 years testifies to the rare privilege afforded and the high demands expected of them it has to be or long term deferment will be brought into disrepute recent developments in other countries with conscription have led some to wonder if there could be further changes in the duration of ns which has stayed the same for 18 years in south korea a landmark supreme court ruling in 2018 found that conscientious objection is a valid reason to forgo military service which is at least 18 months long a law which was revised in 2020 meant that top korean pop stars can postpone their service to when they are 30 the israeli defence forces announced in 2020 that compulsory military service for males has been shortened by two months to 30 meanwhile the taiwanese military has reduced the period of compulsory service to four months since 2013 as part of the transition to an all volunteer force in 2004 ns in singapore was reduced to a maximum of two years this was the first major change in duration since 1971 when training was reduced from 36 to 30 months for officers and from 30 to 24 months for those below the rank of corporal mr ian li an associate research fellow with the military studies programme at rsis said there is perhaps no ideal length of service rather this is dependent on the military's charge context and constraints he said support for national service in singapore is high largely because the necessity of maintaining a robust military option has always been clearly articulated and accepted singapore has also adjusted other supporting components of national service to better meet the requirements of a conscript force such as through improvements in wages

        "content": "singapore although the national service amendment bill was passed on march 14 1967 singapore's first experience with national service actually started in the 1950s a national service law was implemented in 1954 for the part time conscription of eligible male british subjects and federal citizens it was a move opposed by chinese middle school students who felt they were discriminated against by the british government in terms of education and language policies on may 13 that year hundreds of students rioted as they fought against compulsory conscription since 1967 more than a million male singaporeans and permanent residents have served national service ns but as observers and policymakers have noted it will need to continue evolving to fulfil its mandate and take into account the profile of national servicemen the declining birth rate and the changing nature of external threats as foreign minister vivian balakrishnan told parliament last month russia's invasion of ukraine is a reminder that singapore cannot lose the ability to defend itself and this is why the country has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong singapore armed forces saf and to maintain ns the need for a critical number of able bodied men to defend singapore was pressing in the early days of independence in 1965 coming from the painful memories of the japanese occupation and indonesia's policy of konfrontasi then singapore had just two under strength battalions an ageing gunboat and not a single aircraft wrote associate professor albert lau from the national university of singapore's history department in a chapter for a book titled national service in singapore published in 2018 in 1968 britain announced it would accelerate the withdrawal of its troops from singapore by 1971 singapore first sought help from egypt india and israel to build up its armed forces israel responded and it recommended creating a citizens' army of conscripts as the most cost and manpower effective way to build a credible saf in july 1967 the first batch of full time national servicemen nsfs were enlisted to serve in two newly formed battalions today singapore males serve up to two years in either the saf police or the singapore civil defence force with the majority of the enlistees deployed in the saf after completing full time service nsfs become operationally ready national servicemen nsmen which number 350 000 and form the bulk of the armed forces when it is fully mobilised they serve a 10 year cycle and can be called up for up to 40 days a year in 1970 the government changed ns from part time to full time service for all and standardised ns liability to 2 years for both officers and non commissioned officers and two years for other ranks in 2004 the government reduced the conscription period to two years across the board how servicemen are equipped and trained have changed substantially through the years from the first generation thick cottoned temasek green uniform that debuted in 1967 to the latest pixelised version introduced in 2012 that improves comfort and stealth training and standards of regimentation have also evolved in line with a new generation of soldiers that grew up in the digital age a scheme introduced in 2018 allows nsfs with aptitude in cyber security to serve as cyber defenders while studying part time for university credits those enlisting from 2017 can indicate their interest in more than 30 vocations better deployment of servicemen and utilisation of combat platforms with advanced technology will be critical to tackling an expected one third reduction in manpower by 2030 due to falling birth rates said defence minister ng eng hen in a 2019 interview an institute of policy studies survey of 1 200 singaporeans in 2013 showed strong public support for ns with many seeing it as fulfilling a social mission of instilling discipline and values in the young beyond its defence mandate ns is also one of the few issues to receive political support from both the ruling people's action party and the main opposition party the workers' party even so efforts have been made over the years to strengthen understanding and support for ns from 1997 parents were invited to accompany their enlisting sons directly into camp the top level ns review committee recently unveiled initiatives to deploy servicemen of different physical abilities to a wider range of operational roles and for all nsmen to receive a new base pay of at least 1 600 for every month of in camp training they attend the formation of a new digital and intelligence service dis by this year to counter digital threats will mean more nsfs trained in areas that are unlike traditional soldiering roles ns is the bedrock of the saf said prof lau of nus keeping this institution relevant its purpose clear and a united citizenry behind it are key challenges as ns continues to evolve in response to changing

        "content": "singapore the events food and beverage and hospitality sectors among the worst hit by the covid 19 pandemic applauded streamlined covid 19 measures that kicked in on tuesday march 15 but the recovery of these sectors will be limited unless measures ease further said industry insiders changes like lifting specific attendance limits for events with fewer than 1 000 people and removing zoning requirements lower the costs of organising events said mr edward liu managing director of events organiser conference and exhibition management services without the constraints we could save on hiring more temporary staff to man the zones within exhibition halls and the deployment of safe distancing ambassadors he said mr dylan sharma vice president of advocacy and communications at the singapore association of convention and exhibition organisers and suppliers said the meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions mice industry welcomed the streamlining but recovery remains an ongoing journey as we move towards an endemic covid 19 scaling up business capacities to where it was pre pandemic is not so straightforward said mr sharma citing the loss of talent to other industries as many pandemic hit companies scaled back he also said the streamlining is relatively clear around social distancing requirements in settings with and without mask wearing but he added there is a grey area as many events involve both components yet what is allowed at an event is based on the strictest regulations that apply this means events management companies and organisers have their hands tied when it comes to organising events longer than half a day for instance he said it is almost impossible to hold conferences that last for a full day or multiple days without catered food yet catering would mean the rest of the event has to adhere to stricter social distancing rules even when masks are worn outside meal times similar concerns were raised by ms margaret heng executive director of the singapore hotel association sha she said the 160 member hotels of sha hope rules for food and beverage services during business events can be less stringent ms heng said to expedite the industry's recovery we should now address the need to improve revenue contribution from the banqueting and catering segment with the recent streamlining of safe management measures we have seen only a marginal increase in demand especially for smaller event venues she added ideally we will soon be allowed to host larger table sizes beyond five persons to drive more food and beverage revenue for restaurants and event spaces food and beverage industry insiders are also clamouring for an increase in the maximum size of dining groups allowed a spokesman for the restaurant association of singapore said it hopes eight vaccinated people could dine at food and beverage outlets much sooner than later noting that the utilisation of intensive care unit icu beds and number of severe cases in singapore are well under control the only way this streamlining affects the industry is it encourages people to go to houses there has been a drop in inquiries of 15 per cent to 20 per cent as people have been encouraged to entertain at home with multiple groups said chef and restaurateur dave pynt referring to the maximum number of household visitors being eased to five people at a time from five per day he hopes that the 10 30pm limit on serving alcohol to patrons and the need to check in and out on tracetogether among other measures can be lifted this would be much appreciated by the community and the industry now that 95 per cent of the population is vaccinated and with an infection growth rate of under one for over a week and fewer than 30 people in icu he said he added that prolonged restrictions on the industry have prompted him to scrap plans for a new establishment in downtown singapore in favour of an undecided location overseas some medical experts said measures can be eased further without placing more pressure on hospitals i think the social needs of people aren't really going to be satisfied with five people allowed at home at one time and i'm not sure having 10 vaccinated people is really going to destroy hospitals said professor dale fisher senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital in a roundtable discussion organised by the straits times on tuesday we're a species that needs to socialise we're a species that needs to work to provide for our families and to provide for our recreation he said how religious worship is undertaken has also changed with the streamlining of safety measures the catholic community can now make bookings to attend mass at any church rather than the church they are registered with we are also actively looking into increasing the seating capacities of our churches to accommodate more people during masses while still ensuring that our churches continue to be vigilant in enforcing safety measures currently in place said the archbishop's communications office from the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore venerable seck kwang phing president of the singapore buddhist federation said the streamlining which lifted event size limits for religious services means prayer halls can accommodate more devotees to chant together as the halls are small and there was zoning and social distancing some worshippers have tried to make bookings and failed many times larger temples that could have accommodated more devotees under the streamlined rules which permit a maximum capacity of 50 per cent for events with more than 1 000 people have still capped the number of people attending prayer sessions at 1 000 as a precaution against infecting the vulnerable he added but some of the industry insiders st spoke to said it is too early to gauge the effect of the streamlining on their industries while the food and beverage sales figures in december 2021 and january 2022 grew between 17 per cent and 20 per cent as compared with november 2021 figures the recovery still remains to be seen as december and january are typically the festive months of christmas chinese new year and school holidays said the restaurant association spokesman likewise for the events industry where there is a gestation period of six to 12 months for a business event said mr sharma any streamlining of measures that takes place today really serves to catalyse planning for the long term we are not going to see results from april or may but september onwards he said

forces came under closer scrutiny with the high profile death of actor aloysius pang in january 2019 the operationally ready national serviceman was on a live firing exercise in new zealand when he suffered serious crush injuries while operating a singapore self propelled howitzer this came after full time national servicemen dave lee and liu kai died in 2018 in separate incidents and third

chan a former associate research fellow from the military studies programme at the s rajaratnam school of international studies rsis said that training safety is care for soldiers one of the saf's core values in action but this does not mean easier or lax standards it is about removing the peripheral risks and managing the inherent risks in meeting training objectives training imbues personnel with the confidence to address similar risks during operations this is why the saf takes training seriously and its safety record is crucial in securing society's commitment to defence in terms of ns participation and the recruitment and retention of regulars singapore born best selling writer kevin kwan was involved in controversy when it was revealed in august 2018 that he defaulted on his ns in 1990 the crazy rich asians author based in the united states applied and appealed to renounce his singapore citizenship without serving ns but this was rejected in 1994 an average of about 350 people

to return to singapore or remain on the run abroad the structured tier system allows those intending to come back the possibility to plan their life in singapore or their future outside singapore after facing the music including serving full time if they are still eligible to do so he added for those no longer liable for full time service it gives them a sign of relief that there is certainty in the punishment they can expect and their ordeal can finally be over the issue of whether sportsmen should be given deferments to allow them to pursue their careers sparked national debate in august 2018 when footballer benjamin davis then 17 had his request to defer ns denied he was the first singaporean to sign professional terms with an english premier league epl club fulham he became a defaulter in february 2019 when he failed to enlist in a 2018 parliament speech setting out the reasons for his ministry's decision dr ng said to grant deferment to mr ben davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their ns dutifully as required and not at a time of their choosing only three sportsmen have been granted long term deferments in the last 15 years sailor maximilian soh and swimmers joseph schooling and quah zheng wen to allow them to take part in the olympics all three have since enlisted footballer harry birtwistle who signed for another epl club wolverhampton wanderers in october last year has failed to register for ns singapore management university associate professor of law eugene tan said ns serves a critical need for national security for a young nation state and the exceptional nature of long term deferment requires the process to be highly selective and stringent this ensures that the fundamental principles of universality and equity which undergird ns are given effect to if the onerous criteria are not adhered to the morale and commitment to ns and the defence of singapore would be severely weakened he added the fact that only three sportsmen have secured long term deferment in the past 15 years testifies to the rare privilege afforded and the high demands expected of them it has to be or long term deferment will be brought into disrepute recent developments in other countries with conscription have led some to wonder if there could be further changes in the duration of ns which has stayed the same for 18 years in south korea a landmark supreme court ruling in 2018 found that conscientious objection is a valid reason to forgo military service which is at least 18 months long a law which was revised in 2020 meant that top korean pop stars can postpone their service to when they are 30 the israeli defence forces announced in 2020 that compulsory military service for males has been shortened by two months to 30 meanwhile the taiwanese military has reduced the period of compulsory service to four months since 2013 as part of the transition to an all volunteer force in 2004 ns in singapore was reduced to a maximum of two years this was the first major change in duration since 1971 when training was reduced from 36 to 30 months for officers and from 30 to 24 months for those below the rank of corporal mr ian li an associate research fellow with the military studies programme at rsis said there is perhaps no ideal length of service rather this is dependent on the military's charge context and constraints he said support for national service in singapore is high largely because the necessity of maintaining a robust military option has always been clearly articulated and accepted singapore has also adjusted other supporting components of national service to better meet the requirements of a conscript force such as through improvements in wages

        "content": "singapore although the national service amendment bill was passed on march 14 1967 singapore's first experience with national service actually started in the 1950s a national service law was implemented in 1954 for the part time conscription of eligible male british subjects and federal citizens it was a move opposed by chinese middle school students who felt they were discriminated against by the british government in terms of education and language policies on may 13 that year hundreds of students rioted as they fought against compulsory conscription since 1967 more than a million male singaporeans and permanent residents have served national service ns but as observers and policymakers have noted it will need to continue evolving to fulfil its mandate and take into account the profile of national servicemen the declining birth rate and the changing nature of external threats as foreign minister vivian balakrishnan told parliament last month russia's invasion of ukraine is a reminder that singapore cannot lose the ability to defend itself and this is why the country has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong singapore armed forces saf and to maintain ns the need for a critical number of able bodied men to defend singapore was pressing in the early days of independence in 1965 coming from the painful memories of the japanese occupation and indonesia's policy of konfrontasi then singapore had just two under strength battalions an ageing gunboat and not a single aircraft wrote associate professor albert lau from the national university of singapore's history department in a chapter for a book titled national service in singapore published in 2018 in 1968 britain announced it would accelerate the withdrawal of its troops from singapore by 1971 singapore first sought help from egypt india and israel to build up its armed forces israel responded and it recommended creating a citizens' army of conscripts as the most cost and manpower effective way to build a credible saf in july 1967 the first batch of full time national servicemen nsfs were enlisted to serve in two newly formed battalions today singapore males serve up to two years in either the saf police or the singapore civil defence force with the majority of the enlistees deployed in the saf after completing full time service nsfs become operationally ready national servicemen nsmen which number 350 000 and form the bulk of the armed forces when it is fully mobilised they serve a 10 year cycle and can be called up for up to 40 days a year in 1970 the government changed ns from part time to full time service for all and standardised ns liability to 2 years for both officers and non commissioned officers and two years for other ranks in 2004 the government reduced the conscription period to two years across the board how servicemen are equipped and trained have changed substantially through the years from the first generation thick cottoned temasek green uniform that debuted in 1967 to the latest pixelised version introduced in 2012 that improves comfort and stealth training and standards of regimentation have also evolved in line with a new generation of soldiers that grew up in the digital age a scheme introduced in 2018 allows nsfs with aptitude in cyber security to serve as cyber defenders while studying part time for university credits those enlisting from 2017 can indicate their interest in more than 30 vocations better deployment of servicemen and utilisation of combat platforms with advanced technology will be critical to tackling an expected one third reduction in manpower by 2030 due to falling birth rates said defence minister ng eng hen in a 2019 interview an institute of policy studies survey of 1 200 singaporeans in 2013 showed strong public support for ns with many seeing it as fulfilling a social mission of instilling discipline and values in the young beyond its defence mandate ns is also one of the few issues to receive political support from both the ruling people's action party and the main opposition party the workers' party even so efforts have been made over the years to strengthen understanding and support for ns from 1997 parents were invited to accompany their enlisting sons directly into camp the top level ns review committee recently unveiled initiatives to deploy servicemen of different physical abilities to a wider range of operational roles and for all nsmen to receive a new base pay of at least 1 600 for every month of in camp training they attend the formation of a new digital and intelligence service dis by this year to counter digital threats will mean more nsfs trained in areas that are unlike traditional soldiering roles ns is the bedrock of the saf said prof lau of nus keeping this institution relevant its purpose clear and a united citizenry behind it are key challenges as ns continues to evolve in response to changing

        "content": "singapore the events food and beverage and hospitality sectors among the worst hit by the covid 19 pandemic applauded streamlined covid 19 measures that kicked in on tuesday march 15 but the recovery of these sectors will be limited unless measures ease further said industry insiders changes like lifting specific attendance limits for events with fewer than 1 000 people and removing zoning requirements lower the costs of organising events said mr edward liu managing director of events organiser conference and exhibition management services without the constraints we could save on hiring more temporary staff to man the zones within exhibition halls and the deployment of safe distancing ambassadors he said mr dylan sharma vice president of advocacy and communications at the singapore association of convention and exhibition organisers and suppliers said the meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions mice industry welcomed the streamlining but recovery remains an ongoing journey as we move towards an endemic covid 19 scaling up business capacities to where it was pre pandemic is not so straightforward said mr sharma citing the loss of talent to other industries as many pandemic hit companies scaled back he also said the streamlining is relatively clear around social distancing requirements in settings with and without mask wearing but he added there is a grey area as many events involve both components yet what is allowed at an event is based on the strictest regulations that apply this means events management companies and organisers have their hands tied when it comes to organising events longer than half a day for instance he said it is almost impossible to hold conferences that last for a full day or multiple days without catered food yet catering would mean the rest of the event has to adhere to stricter social distancing rules even when masks are worn outside meal times similar concerns were raised by ms margaret heng executive director of the singapore hotel association sha she said the 160 member hotels of sha hope rules for food and beverage services during business events can be less stringent ms heng said to expedite the industry's recovery we should now address the need to improve revenue contribution from the banqueting and catering segment with the recent streamlining of safe management measures we have seen only a marginal increase in demand especially for smaller event venues she added ideally we will soon be allowed to host larger table sizes beyond five persons to drive more food and beverage revenue for restaurants and event spaces food and beverage industry insiders are also clamouring for an increase in the maximum size of dining groups allowed a spokesman for the restaurant association of singapore said it hopes eight vaccinated people could dine at food and beverage outlets much sooner than later noting that the utilisation of intensive care unit icu beds and number of severe cases in singapore are well under control the only way this streamlining affects the industry is it encourages people to go to houses there has been a drop in inquiries of 15 per cent to 20 per cent as people have been encouraged to entertain at home with multiple groups said chef and restaurateur dave pynt referring to the maximum number of household visitors being eased to five people at a time from five per day he hopes that the 10 30pm limit on serving alcohol to patrons and the need to check in and out on tracetogether among other measures can be lifted this would be much appreciated by the community and the industry now that 95 per cent of the population is vaccinated and with an infection growth rate of under one for over a week and fewer than 30 people in icu he said he added that prolonged restrictions on the industry have prompted him to scrap plans for a new establishment in downtown singapore in favour of an undecided location overseas some medical experts said measures can be eased further without placing more pressure on hospitals i think the social needs of people aren't really going to be satisfied with five people allowed at home at one time and i'm not sure having 10 vaccinated people is really going to destroy hospitals said professor dale fisher senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital in a roundtable discussion organised by the straits times on tuesday we're a species that needs to socialise we're a species that needs to work to provide for our families and to provide for our recreation he said how religious worship is undertaken has also changed with the streamlining of safety measures the catholic community can now make bookings to attend mass at any church rather than the church they are registered with we are also actively looking into increasing the seating capacities of our churches to accommodate more people during masses while still ensuring that our churches continue to be vigilant in enforcing safety measures currently in place said the archbishop's communications office from the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore venerable seck kwang phing president of the singapore buddhist federation said the streamlining which lifted event size limits for religious services means prayer halls can accommodate more devotees to chant together as the halls are small and there was zoning and social distancing some worshippers have tried to make bookings and failed many times larger temples that could have accommodated more devotees under the streamlined rules which permit a maximum capacity of 50 per cent for events with more than 1 000 people have still capped the number of people attending prayer sessions at 1 000 as a precaution against infecting the vulnerable he added but some of the industry insiders st spoke to said it is too early to gauge the effect of the streamlining on their industries while the food and beverage sales figures in december 2021 and january 2022 grew between 17 per cent and 20 per cent as compared with november 2021 figures the recovery still remains to be seen as december and january are typically the festive months of christmas chinese new year and school holidays said the restaurant association spokesman likewise for the events industry where there is a gestation period of six to 12 months for a business event said mr sharma any streamlining of measures that takes place today really serves to catalyse planning for the long term we are not going to see results from april or may but september onwards he said

served ns a key pillar of defence but the rite of passage for men here continues to evolve the straits times reviews four key areas that have drawn attention training safety in the singapore armed forces came under closer scrutiny with the high profile death of actor aloysius pang in january 2019 the operationally ready national serviceman was on a live firing exercise in new zealand when he suffered serious crush injuries while operating a singapore self propelled howitzer this came after full time national servicemen dave lee and liu kai died in 2018 in separate incidents and third sergeant gavin chan hiang cheng died in exercise wallaby in australia in 2017 since mr pang's death a top level inspector general's office was set up to improve safety at all levels of the saf through efforts such as doing audits and assessing the safety culture at units with the aim of achieving zero training fatalities no training or operations related death has been reported since then dr samuel chan a former associate research fellow from the military studies programme at the s rajaratnam school of international studies rsis said that training safety is care for soldiers one of the saf's core values in action but this does not mean easier or lax standards it is about removing the peripheral risks and managing the inherent risks in meeting training objectives training imbues personnel with the confidence to address similar risks during operations this is why the saf takes training seriously and its safety record is crucial in securing society's commitment to defence in terms of ns participation and the recruitment and retention of regulars singapore born best selling writer kevin kwan was involved in controversy when it was revealed in august 2018 that he defaulted on his ns in 1990 the crazy rich asians author based in the united states applied and appealed to renounce his singapore citizenship without serving ns but this was rejected in 1994 an average of about 350 people default on their ns requirements each year said defence minister ng eng hen in a parliamentary reply in 2018 they either failed to register or enlist for ns a sentencing framework by the high court in 2017 introduced four tiers of punishment based on the length of the default period the written judgment noted that the principles affecting ns are national security universality where all those who are fit to serve must do so and equity everyone must be treated the same way regardless of background or status this was spelt out by then minister for defence teo chee hean in a ministerial statement in parliament in 2006 since the framework was introduced 18 defaulters have been sentenced lawyer laurence goh said the introduction of the framework has given more certainty to those deciding whether to return to singapore or remain on the run abroad the structured tier system allows those intending to come back the possibility to plan their life in singapore or their future outside singapore after facing the music including serving full time if they are still eligible to do so he added for those no longer liable for full time service it gives them a sign of relief that there is certainty in the punishment they can expect and their ordeal can finally be over the issue of whether sportsmen should be given deferments to allow them to pursue their careers sparked national debate in august 2018 when footballer benjamin davis then 17 had his request to defer ns denied he was the first singaporean to sign professional terms with an english premier league epl club fulham he became a defaulter in february 2019 when he failed to enlist in a 2018 parliament speech setting out the reasons for his ministry's decision dr ng said to grant deferment to mr ben davis to pursue his personal development and professional career would be unfair to the many others who have served their ns dutifully as required and not at a time of their choosing only three sportsmen have been granted long term deferments in the last 15 years sailor maximilian soh and swimmers joseph schooling and quah zheng wen to allow them to take part in the olympics all three have since enlisted footballer harry birtwistle who signed for another epl club wolverhampton wanderers in october last year has failed to register for ns singapore management university associate professor of law eugene tan said ns serves a critical need for national security for a young nation state and the exceptional nature of long term deferment requires the process to be highly selective and stringent this ensures that the fundamental principles of universality and equity which undergird ns are given effect to if the onerous criteria are not adhered to the morale and commitment to ns and the defence of singapore would be severely weakened he added the fact that only three sportsmen have secured long term deferment in the past 15 years testifies to the rare privilege afforded and the high demands expected of them it has to be or long term deferment will be brought into disrepute recent developments in other countries with conscription have led some to wonder if there could be further changes in the duration of ns which has stayed the same for 18 years in south korea a landmark supreme court ruling in 2018 found that conscientious objection is a valid reason to forgo military service which is at least 18 months long a law which was revised in 2020 meant that top korean pop stars can postpone their service to when they are 30 the israeli defence forces announced in 2020 that compulsory military service for males has been shortened by two months to 30 meanwhile the taiwanese military has reduced the period of compulsory service to four months since 2013 as part of the transition to an all volunteer force in 2004 ns in singapore was reduced to a maximum of two years this was the first major change in duration since 1971 when training was reduced from 36 to 30 months for officers and from 30 to 24 months for those below the rank of corporal mr ian li an associate research fellow with the military studies programme at rsis said there is perhaps no ideal length of service rather this is dependent on the military's charge context and constraints he said support for national service in singapore is high largely because the necessity of maintaining a robust military option has always been clearly

        "content": "singapore although the national service amendment bill was passed on march 14 1967 singapore's first experience with national service actually started in the 1950s a national service law was implemented in 1954 for the part time conscription of eligible male british subjects and federal citizens it was a move opposed by chinese middle school students who felt they were discriminated against by the british government in terms of education and language policies on may 13 that year hundreds of students rioted as they fought against compulsory conscription since 1967 more than a million male singaporeans and permanent residents have served national service ns but as observers and policymakers have noted it will need to continue evolving to fulfil its mandate and take into account the profile of national servicemen the declining birth rate and the changing nature of external threats as foreign minister vivian balakrishnan told parliament last month russia's invasion of ukraine is a reminder that singapore cannot lose the ability to defend itself and this is why the country has invested consistently to build up a credible and strong singapore armed forces saf and to maintain ns the need for a critical number of able bodied men to defend singapore was pressing in the early days of independence in 1965 coming from the painful memories of the japanese occupation and indonesia's policy of konfrontasi then singapore had just two under strength battalions an ageing gunboat and not a single aircraft wrote associate professor albert lau from the national university of singapore's history department in a chapter for a book titled national service in singapore published in 2018 in 1968 britain announced it would accelerate the withdrawal of its troops from singapore by 1971 singapore first sought help from egypt india and israel to build up its armed forces israel responded and it recommended creating a citizens' army of conscripts as the most cost and manpower effective way to build a credible saf in july 1967 the first batch of full time national servicemen nsfs were enlisted to serve in two newly formed battalions today singapore males serve up to two years in either the saf police or the singapore civil defence force with the majority of the enlistees deployed in the saf after completing full time service nsfs become operationally ready national servicemen nsmen which number 350 000 and form the bulk of the armed forces when it is fully mobilised they serve a 10 year cycle and can be called up for up to 40 days a year in 1970 the government changed ns from part time to full time service for all and standardised ns liability to 2 years for both officers and non commissioned officers and two years for other ranks in 2004 the government reduced the conscription period to two years across the board how servicemen are equipped and trained have changed substantially through the years from the first generation thick cottoned temasek green uniform that debuted in 1967 to the latest pixelised version introduced in 2012 that improves comfort and stealth training and standards of regimentation have also evolved in line with a new generation of soldiers that grew up in the digital age a scheme introduced in 2018 allows nsfs with aptitude in cyber security to serve as cyber defenders while studying part time for university credits those enlisting from 2017 can indicate their interest in more than 30 vocations better deployment of servicemen and utilisation of combat platforms with advanced technology will be critical to tackling an expected one third reduction in manpower by 2030 due to falling birth rates said defence minister ng eng hen in a 2019 interview an institute of policy studies survey of 1 200 singaporeans in 2013 showed strong public support for ns with many seeing it as fulfilling a social mission of instilling discipline and values in the young beyond its defence mandate ns is also one of the few issues to receive political support from both the ruling people's action party and the main opposition party the workers' party even so efforts have been made over the years to strengthen understanding and support for ns from 1997 parents were invited to accompany their enlisting sons directly into camp the top level ns review committee recently unveiled initiatives to deploy servicemen of different physical abilities to a wider range of operational roles and for all nsmen to receive a new base pay of at least 1 600 for every month of in camp training they attend the formation of a new digital and intelligence service dis by this year to counter digital threats will mean more nsfs trained in areas that are unlike traditional soldiering roles ns is the bedrock of the saf said prof lau of nus keeping this institution relevant its purpose clear and a united citizenry behind it are key challenges as ns continues to evolve in response to changing

        "content": "singapore the events food and beverage and hospitality sectors among the worst hit by the covid 19 pandemic applauded streamlined covid 19 measures that kicked in on tuesday march 15 but the recovery of these sectors will be limited unless measures ease further said industry insiders changes like lifting specific attendance limits for events with fewer than 1 000 people and removing zoning requirements lower the costs of organising events said mr edward liu managing director of events organiser conference and exhibition management services without the constraints we could save on hiring more temporary staff to man the zones within exhibition halls and the deployment of safe distancing ambassadors he said mr dylan sharma vice president of advocacy and communications at the singapore association of convention and exhibition organisers and suppliers said the meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions mice industry welcomed the streamlining but recovery remains an ongoing journey as we move towards an endemic covid 19 scaling up business capacities to where it was pre pandemic is not so straightforward said mr sharma citing the loss of talent to other industries as many pandemic hit companies scaled back he also said the streamlining is relatively clear around social distancing requirements in settings with and without mask wearing but he added there is a grey area as many events involve both components yet what is allowed at an event is based on the strictest regulations that apply this means events management companies and organisers have their hands tied when it comes to organising events longer than half a day for instance he said it is almost impossible to hold conferences that last for a full day or multiple days without catered food yet catering would mean the rest of the event has to adhere to stricter social distancing rules even when masks are worn outside meal times similar concerns were raised by ms margaret heng executive director of the singapore hotel association sha she said the 160 member hotels of sha hope rules for food and beverage services during business events can be less stringent ms heng said to expedite the industry's recovery we should now address the need to improve revenue contribution from the banqueting and catering segment with the recent streamlining of safe management measures we have seen only a marginal increase in demand especially for smaller event venues she added ideally we will soon be allowed to host larger table sizes beyond five persons to drive more food and beverage revenue for restaurants and event spaces food and beverage industry insiders are also clamouring for an increase in the maximum size of dining groups allowed a spokesman for the restaurant association of singapore said it hopes eight vaccinated people could dine at food and beverage outlets much sooner than later noting that the utilisation of intensive care unit icu beds and number of severe cases in singapore are well under control the only way this streamlining affects the industry is it encourages people to go to houses there has been a drop in inquiries of 15 per cent to 20 per cent as people have been encouraged to entertain at home with multiple groups said chef and restaurateur dave pynt referring to the maximum number of household visitors being eased to five people at a time from five per day he hopes that the 10 30pm limit on serving alcohol to patrons and the need to check in and out on tracetogether among other measures can be lifted this would be much appreciated by the community and the industry now that 95 per cent of the population is vaccinated and with an infection growth rate of under one for over a week and fewer than 30 people in icu he said he added that prolonged restrictions on the industry have prompted him to scrap plans for a new establishment in downtown singapore in favour of an undecided location overseas some medical experts said measures can be eased further without placing more pressure on hospitals i think the social needs of people aren't really going to be satisfied with five people allowed at home at one time and i'm not sure having 10 vaccinated people is really going to destroy hospitals said professor dale fisher senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital in a roundtable discussion organised by the straits times on tuesday we're a species that needs to socialise we're a species that needs to work to provide for our families and to provide for our recreation he said how religious worship is undertaken has also changed with the streamlining of safety measures the catholic community can now make bookings to attend mass at any church rather than the church they are registered with we are also actively looking into increasing the seating capacities of our churches to accommodate more people during masses while still ensuring that our churches continue to be vigilant in enforcing safety measures currently in place said the archbishop's communications office from the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore venerable seck kwang phing president of the singapore buddhist federation said the streamlining which lifted event size limits for religious services means prayer halls can accommodate more devotees to chant together as the halls are small and there was zoning and social distancing some worshippers have tried to make bookings and failed many times larger temples that could have accommodated more devotees under the streamlined rules which permit a maximum capacity of 50 per cent for events with more than 1 000 people have still capped the number of people attending prayer sessions at 1 000 as a precaution against infecting the vulnerable he added but some of the industry insiders st spoke to said it is too early to gauge the effect of the streamlining on their industries while the food and beverage sales figures in december 2021 and january 2022 grew between 17 per cent and 20 per cent as compared with november 2021 figures the recovery still remains to be seen as december and january are typically the festive months of christmas chinese new year and school holidays said the restaurant association spokesman likewise for the events industry where there is a gestation period of six to 12 months for a business event said mr sharma any streamlining of measures that takes place today really serves to catalyse planning for the long term we are not going to see results from april or may but september onwards he said

        "content": "singapore express or normal academic after getting his primary school leaving examination results jonas ng was faced with a choice that would seemingly decide his whole future i preferred the slower pace of lessons in the normal academic course but also wanted to stretch myself in subjects i was strong in said jonas now 15 then he learnt that gan eng seng school would be one of the schools piloting full subject based banding sbb in 2020 for the secondary 1 cohort and decided to apply to the school he felt it would be having the best of both worlds under full sbb students from the express normal academic and normal technical streams are placed in the same mixed form class and take six non academic subjects together known as common curriculum subjects they include art physical education and food and consumer education for subjects like english mathematics or history students will attend lessons in different classes based on their ability for each subject this means students who perform well in certain subjects would be able to take them at a more demanding level in the middle of the year or the following year jonas for instance was among the top sec 1 scorers in geography from the normal academic stream and went on to take the subject at the express level in sec 2 i'm very interested in geography so i felt really happy to take it at a more demanding level said jonas who is now in sec 3 his mother madam fion farn 44 a manager said this was a big boost to his confidence now that he knows he has his strengths he is motivated interacting with students who are better in the subject also helps to motivate him the environment helped to build his confidence she said she said full sbb has helped students from the normal academic stream like her son find their niche some of the students from the normal academic stream are very hardworking and focused we should do away with the old thinking that they are lazy or not interested in studying it is a matter of finding their strengths and interests she added last week education minister chan chun sing announced that by next year about 90 schools or more than two thirds of secondary schools would have implemented full sbb when full sbb is fully implemented in secondary schools in 2024 there will no longer be express normal academic and normal technical streams students can take subjects at three levels g1 g2 and g3 g stands for general and the levels are broadly mapped from today's normal technical normal academic and express standards respectively the school started preparing for full sbb in june 2019 by inviting two former students from the normal academic and normal technical streams to share their school experiences the former student from the normal technical stream said he felt that the general expectation of students taking the normal technical stream was not very high recalled gan eng seng school vice principal sara selva he also felt that certain kinds of behaviour seemed to be tolerated as students from the normal technical stream were perceived to act in a certain manner mrs selva recalled he shared that it was quite a painful experience to think that others felt that about them calling the sharing experience an eye opener she added moving forward we had to address the issue with that as a starting point the school went about planning for the implementation of full sbb in december 2019 teachers took a vote on whether form classes should include a mix of students taking the express and normal academic courses both the normal academic and normal technical courses or all three courses all voted for having three streams in a class this model however made planning the timetable a huge challenge compounding this was the fact that the school had decided to give each child a personalised timetable so that it is not so obvious which stream they came from said mrs selva the timetable went through several iterations before roll out it was a lot of work with different timetables for different combinations it was tedious but we did it she said teachers known for their capacity to build strong rapport with students were asked to lead the first batch of students they attended workshops on how to conduct lessons with differentiated instructions to engage students of varying abilities in their classes more classrooms had to be created for the full sbb classes one room came from the alumni who fully supported the programme and gave the use of the alumni room in the day for lessons classes were also renamed to remove identifiers with particular streams mrs selva said tang hui xian a sec 2 student from the normal academic stream at gan eng seng said she was surprised to find out that her form class consisted of students from different streams and she was initially afraid she would not be able to mix well with them i am not a sociable person and it is difficult for me to make new friends i was worried that i wouldn't be able to communicate with those from other streams said the 14 year old she eventually realised it was not that difficult to make friends from different streams as they attended classes such as art design and technology and food and consumer education together taking maths and geography at the express level has also helped her to make friends from the express stream if i don't understand a question i usually ask my friends who take mathematics and geography with me and they always help me she said i feel very fortunate to have friends from different streams we help one another puteri ellyanti a sec 2 student from the normal technical stream said she liked being in a mixed form class despite her initial reservation as there were just five students from her stream out of 37 students in her form class she is close to three classmates from the express stream and they often hang out together during recess she said i like having friends from different streams if i don't know anything they can teach me she added puteri has been taking malay language at the normal academic level and hopes to be able to take more subjects at a more demanding level to challenge herself the help goes both ways as students from the express stream find themselves learning from their friends from the other streams sec 2 student raouf bamadhaj 14 from the express stream said full sbb has helped him widen his circle of friends i'm quite shy and will try to stick to my circle of friends during recess now students from different streams sit together it wouldn't have been possible for me without full sbb he said he has also sought help from his classmates from other streams a classmate once drew a lifelike dish of chicken rice and sugar cane drink and he asked her for tips on using different colours and techniques she shared them with me but no my drawing didn't improve after that he chuckled maths teacher sultan shah has had to review and tweak his old worksheets for his classes since the school started offering full sbb with some students in the normal academic stream taking maths at the express level his class is now more heterogeneous said mr shah who has been teaching for five years his worksheets are now designed to engage the mix of students two out of five questions may be basic for instance while others may be more challenging questions that he would guide some students with even as others tackle everything on their own full sbb has forced me to consider teaching the same topics in different ways he said adding that he has benefited as a teacher as he now has a wider repertoire of teaching strategies the same goes for english language teacher chandrima roy who has come up with multiple ways for students to present their learning for instance some might write an essay some might like to do an audio recording while others might like to write it as a letter with drawings if we give them the option of presenting their thoughts in multiple ways it makes it easier for them to learn she said mrs roy who also teaches character and citizenship education one of the common curriculum subjects said she has seen her students become more inclusive they have become more appreciative of the diversity in the classroom they can accept the fact that someone might be different mrs roy who has been teaching for 31 years added that not only has full sbb done away with labels that might be demeaning to the students but it has also resulted in greater camaraderie in the class and empathy among students she recalled a heartwarming incident in which a student did well enough in english to move from offering it at the normal academic level to the express level in the middle of the year and the whole class clapped and cheered for their classmate year head and physical education teacher clarence loh who has been teaching for 15 years observed that the blurring of streams is evident as students form friendships that are not based on academic ability structures drive behaviour now with no more streams per se students look at one another as individuals and enjoy being with one another because of common shared interests instead of being bound by academic ability he said full sbb may have entailed more challenges in timetabling and required teachers to adopt a diverse range of teaching methods but gan eng seng school's teachers say it has been worth the effort mrs selva the school's vice principal said full sbb does not pigeonhole students by their abilities it gives students hope that if i am in the normal technical stream it doesn't mean i'm stuck there if i'm good at art i can offer normal academic art if i'm excellent i may be able to offer express art which is an opportunity that the students never had in the past she said another positive by product of full sbb has been the improvement in the discipline of the students several teachers said school attendance behaviour and discipline are less of an issue now compared with before they said students have the chance to pick up learning norms in mixed classes noted design and technology teacher serene see toh who has been teaching for 19 years maybe they were exposed to a rowdy classroom in the past and thought that was the norm but in a mixed class this is rare it gives students that chance to experience a more positive learning environment mrs selva added there are very good role models in the class no matter which stream the students are from good behaviour is learnt through role modelling principal tan hwee pin added that full sbb aimed to offer students a greater choice in pursuing subjects that better matched their strengths and interest and the positive effects of social mixing that was observed came as a bonus parents whose children

        "content": "as part of a series on university education the straits times responds to a question on engineering degrees q my father is an engineer and so is my maternal grandfather i have been inspired by them to study engineering as well at nanyang technological university ntu or national university of singapore but my friends say that with my grades i can aim for something more competitive and exciting some of them feel that engineering is a boring subject and such a degree does not really offer many career options what is your advice a it is good that you feel inspired by your father and grandfather to take up an engineering degree what engineers do is indeed exciting and inspirational what makes engineering interesting is that it covers a wide range of disciplines from rockets to mobile phones to hip and knee replacements at the heart of it an engineer is a problem solver engineers use their knowledge to provide solutions to complex problems i asked ntu's dean of engineering professor louis phee what he tells young people seeking his advice on engineering ntu's engineering education has been ranked highly in some league tables engineering and technology as a broad subject area has been ranked fourth best in the world by london based education consultancy qs for instance prof phee who is also the university's vice president of innovation and entrepreneurship said if you are the type to wonder why golf balls have dimples on them or why split level houses experience more damage in earthquakes then engineering may be the right choice for you it can help you answer questions and push you to ask new questions and find new solutions learning to think like an engineer is another good reason to enter the field he said your entire thought process changes you acquire logical thinking and critical analytical kills decision making skills are improved you become more objective and less emotional when it comes to work all of these skills are greatly needed in the professional world in any field so engineers tend to do better no matter which sector they choose and they also tend to make good managers so much so engineering is the most common undergraduate degree among fortune 500 chief executives at the core engineers are problem solvers and students completing an engineering degree would have acquired the skills and confidence to deal with any kind of problem even beyond working life he said you will know exactly how to go about it and where to hit it no problem no matter how big will seem insurmountable in fact you will start viewing every problem as a challenge and an opportunity to grow it is also an education for the present and the future where we are faced with complex global challenges such as climate change imagine a special coating that could one day turn every window into an energy generator while insulating homes from heat or 'self healing' concrete that allows cracks in buildings and roads to be fixed just by reacting with rain such innovations would require one to harness a combination of civil electrical materials and chemical engineering approaches in this sense engineering is never boring but full of different challenges where different perspectives are required prof phee said hence engineering education around the world has become highly interdisciplinary in nature at ntu there are new pathways for experiential and collaborative learning such as the interdisciplinary collaborative core curriculum rolled out last year to expose students to disciplines beyond their field of study for instance with the growing importance of data analytics all engineering students must take a course on data science and artificial intelligence first year engineering students in the upcoming academic year in august will be able to opt for a new second major in data analytics ntu also places a strong emphasis on inculcating an entrepreneurial mindset since last year it has offered a second major in entrepreneurship beyond the classroom ntu offers a broad range of programmes that offer unique learning opportunities for instance its strong ties with the industry at large means engineering students get the opportunity to work with heavyweights such as dyson alibaba and rolls royce students also benefit from global education cultural immersion and work learn programmes at both local and overseas universities since you want a rigorous programme that will stretch you you may want to consider ntu's renaissance engineering programme a four and a half year dual degree programme that provides broad based interdisciplinary engineering education which integrates engineering science business technology management and humanities this programme takes in more than 40 academically bright students each year and they will graduate with a bachelor of engineering science and a master of science in technology management students on the programme are encouraged to view problems not in silo but in totality resulting in a distinctive breed of engineers with the ability to bridge the gap between science engineering and business these students also have the opportunity to spend the third year overseas at one of the renowned partner universities prof phee said the demand for engineers is growing across a wide variety of industries for one thing the ambitious targets set under the recently announced singapore green plan 2030 underlines the fact that more engineers will be needed in the private sector technology firm dyson is set to grow its engineering team in singapore by 50 per cent and it is one in a long line of companies doing so the recent banking scam also shows the importance of cyber security engineers in the finance sector ms april khong a financial crime risk analyst with fintech railsbank studied information engineering and media at ntu the 24 year old said many of her peers went on to degree related jobs such as in user interface design but when railsbank where she had been an intern offered her a permanent job she asked if she could take up a new role as a financial crime risk analyst ms khong who was involved in a few social service start ups while studying at ntu said scams affecting elderly people really tug at my heartstrings and i want to do something about it that's why i asked my employer if it would let me take on the position of financial crime risk analyst although her job is not related to her degree studies she emphasised that at the end of the day her job is about analysing a problem understanding it and solving it which her engineering education prepared her for you often hear about how engineering prepares you for all kinds of jobs in all kinds of industries it's not just a marketing slogan it's true get the st

        "content": "in this part of the askst education series senior education correspondent sandra davie responds to two questions from parents on the singapore university of social sciences a it is admirable that young people such as your daughter aspire to work to bring about positive changes in people's lives i am not sure what you mean by average grades but first i want to make the point that admission to universities is not based on academic grades alone all the local universities including suss use a more holistic admission process where they look beyond academic grades this is especially so for courses such as social work early childhood education and nursing where the universities also look for interest and aptitude in the field for entry into suss the minimum requirement is two a level passes for the part time programme the selection is a bit more stringent for the full time programme and better grades are required suss uses a four stage selection process for its full time programmes which comprises a 30 minute essay a 12 minute cognitive test a group discussion and an individual or cluster interview the interviews are used to gauge applicants' interest in social work here your daughter's involvement in voluntary work will put her in good stead suss' four year bachelor of social work is a direct honours programme designed to develop a student's knowledge and skills as positive change agents in society it also prepares students for indirect social work in the areas of social policy planning and evaluation suss has done away with the usual lecture tutorials way of teaching and instead uses blended learning which means all the materials are available online before the start of the course students usually go through the powerpoint slides the study guide and the chunked lecture recordings before class the classes usually with about 40 students are meant for students to clarify what they could not understand from the materials the lecture will also use case studies and other means to illustrate how theories are applied in practice most suss lecturers are practitioners in the field or practitioners turned academics there are usually robust discussions in class suss is also known for its close collaboration with the industry which allows the lecturers to review and make quick changes to the curriculum when new needs arise the university also sends its students out into the industry for practicum and research collaborations where they get to work on real world problems social work students are also required to complete 1 000 hours of supervised social work in organisations take up an overseas experience and have community engagement the university aims to produce graduates who are professionally competent social minded and self directed learners social work graduates suss says can look forward to enriching careers in family service centres children and youth centres hospitals hospices and other community or social service agencies there will always be a demand for social workers as new needs continually arise in society and as people become more forthcoming in asking for help the ministry of health and the national council of social service ncss are the biggest employers of social workers but other groups such as the ministry of home affairs and ministry of education moe also employ them moe for example deploys social workers to schools the starting salaries of social work graduates compiled by ncss range from 3 500 to 4 400 a suss offers skillsfuture work study degrees wsdegs which combine academic learning and workplace learning these programmes are co designed by suss and companies to closely integrate classroom learning with structured on the job training students acquire work relevant skills through on the job training making them more work ready upon graduation at suss wsdegs are open to individuals who have been accepted as full time undergraduates by the university and by a host organisation offering on the job training most wsdeg students take about the same time to complete their degree programmes like other normal degree programmes which is four years or shorter as an illustration a wsdeg student may study full time in years 1 and 2 of his or her programme followed by an attachment to the host company for a minimum duration of 12 months in the third and or fourth year students may alternate between spending one to two semesters in university and at the workplace or spend several days at work and university during a week the on the job training co designed and co delivered with partner companies provides students with learning opportunities to apply the knowledge they acquired in the classroom at the workplace suss currently offers wsdeg programmes in accountancy human resource management business analytics finance marketing and supply chain management one obvious advantage of work study degrees is that the students acquire deep work relevant skills and can better transit to the workplace upon graduation employers say they support the programme because students gain a strong grounding in applicable theory in a real work environment which enhances their job readiness students can also learn more about the sponsoring company's work culture and they stand a good chance to be offered career opportunities with the organisation upon graduation the partner companies offer a stipend and other benefits during on the job training suss says 15 of its 24 wsdeg graduates to date have chosen to work in the same company upon graduation get the st smart

spots for computer degree studies a the ministry of education moe has not said exactly how many university places it has planned to offer in the six local universities this year but rest assured that it will offer enough places to ensure at least a 40 per cent cohort participation rate which means that four in 10 of the age group going into university will be given places in the university also as the straits times reported last week moe said it will consider opening up more places in the six local universities for students whose plans to study overseas have been hit by the pandemic it will consider doing this even if the cohort participation rate for singaporeans again goes beyond 40 per cent education minister chan chun sing said in an interview with st that the cohort participation rate had gone past 40 per cent in the last two years to accommodate students who could not go overseas in 2020 the six universities here took in 17 500 students in total and last year they increased this further to 17 800 places the cohort participation rate reached 42 per cent in both years a in recent years the universities have increased the number of courses in this field which are officially referred to as information and digital technology idt degrees as a result the number of places has also gone up significantly in reply to your question moe said that with falling student cohort sizes idt places cannot increase indefinitely without eventually affecting the manpower pipeline for other important economic sectors it said it will need to take a calibrated approach when considering any further increase to idt places to distribute talent across the whole of singapore's economy a your son has chosen a popular field of study that offers good job prospects computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our lives from the cars we drive to how we work to how we entertain ourselves a computing degree can open the door to an array of high paying fields such as software engineering web development information technology and network systems administration in reply to your questions the dean of smu school of computing and information systems scis professor pang hwee hwa said the school currently offers four undergraduate computing programmes that target different job roles demanded by employers smu's computer science degree emphasises strong technical skills in translating scientific principles to usable computing technologies and solutions as well as the management skills needed to navigate complex software development and system deployment concerns its information systems degree teaches students to identify emerging technologies and market trends and exploit opportunities to digitally transform an organisation under information systems smu also offers a smart city management and technology major which is a unique interdisciplinary programme that trains professionals in blending technology social economic business and environmental concerns to develop smart city solutions the school also offers a bsc in computing and law in partnership with the smu yong pung how school of law the degree equips students with the skillsets to protect technology innovation comply with legal and regulatory requirements as well as manage technology and business risks posed by innovation smu is working towards offering a new computing degree from august this year in software engineering this is a work study degree that combines classroom learning and structured on the job training and is geared towards training students for full stack developer careers in response to the high demand for computing graduates scis has been increasing its enrolment over the last few years it admitted over 535 students into its computing degree programmes last year and it will increase enrolment this year prof pang had good advice on choosing from the various computing degree programmes he said students should first decide which area they would like to specialise in and then consider the unique value propositions of smu and the computing degrees it offers the computing profession encompasses a wide range of job roles he said the choice should be driven by considerations of target job roles subject areas of interest and any prerequisites of each degree programmes he said students interested in degrees offered by scis should

        "content": " nytimes most four year degrees pay off by paving the way for graduates to recoup the cost of their education quite quickly a new analysis finds but that's particularly true for some programmes while others may offer little economic advantage over a high school diploma the findings are part of a us report on some 38 000 post high school degree and certificate programmes published by third way a public policy group the report analysed data collected for the federal education department's college scorecard tool to measure the return on investment offered by various higher education programmes the findings show that almost two thirds of the 26 000 bachelor's degree programmes in the study enabled a majority of their graduates to make enough money to recover their costs in 10 years or less after graduation bachelor's degree programmes which typically take four years are generally more expensive but are most likely to show at least some return on investment meaning graduates earn enough to pay off their college costs reasonably quickly for those who complete a degree compared with two year associate degrees or shorter certificate programmes that's good news for students who completed those four year programmes said the report's author michael itzkowitz a senior fellow for higher education at third way and a former director of the college scorecard however certain fields of study typically those in higher paying fields like engineering or health care are substantially more likely to lead to a speedier economic boost than fields like the arts religion or biology all of the largest programmes in electrical and communications engineering for instance allowed most of their graduates to recoup their educational investment in five years or less but many programmes in some fields like drama and dance show no return on investment the report found meaning most of their graduates are earning less than a typical high school graduate it's not surprising said mr itzkowitz but it is depressing it doesn't mean his report said that programmes with little economic return on investment provide no societal value but it does suggest that the economic return in certain fields may be limited perhaps because the jobs available pay too little or offer unstable career opportunities ms lisa sohmer an independent college consultant said such findings needed to be kept in perspective while a college education is an investment she said it pays off in ways that aren't strictly financial students are exposed to new ideas she said and learn about strengths and interests they didn't know they had it's about exploring learning growing she said the goal is not to come out the way you went in the report found most graduates of the vast majority of bachelor's programmes regardless of the field of study were likely to earn more than if they hadn't enrolled programmes at public institutions offered the highest likelihood that graduates would be able to recoup their investment within five to 10 years the report found programmes offered at for profit colleges are the least likely to offer a good return on investment to their graduates the report found just 40 per cent of for profit programmes show graduates recouping costs within 10 years compared with 73 per cent for public programs and 56 per cent for private non profit programmes here are some questions and answers about college costs the average published cost of a four year public university including in state tuition fees room and board is about us 22 000 s 29 500 a year according to the college board average annual costs at four year private non profit colleges are well over twice that amount the report estimated how long it takes to recover a student's net college costs based on the earnings premium a student gains by attending college here's an example if a student graduates with a degree in business and earns us 15 000 more than the typical high school graduate in the state the earnings premium is us 15 000 if the degree cost us 60 000 it would take four years to recoup the cost if a majority of students who graduated from a programme are able to recoup their costs in 10 years or less the programme is considered to offer a reasonable return on investment five years or less is even better the report looked at roughly 2 2 million students who graduated in 2015 and 2016 their earnings were measured two years later 2017 and 2018 then adjusted to 2019 dollars it looked at out of pocket costs that a graduate would pay after deducting grants and scholarships college consultants caution against choosing a course of study solely because of its potential salary it's often difficult for high school juniors for example to know what areas or careers will interest them six years later or longer if they attend graduate school said mr jeff levy an independent educational consultant and exposure to new ideas and topics in college may spur interest in career paths that they don't yet know about he said i would advise families to ignore the data he said it's noise he did suggest that students who are interested in a degree because it currently appears lucrative say nursing seek volunteer experience in the field that will help determine if they really want to pursue the degree and will help them when applying because such programmes are often highly competitive ms carrie warick director of policy and advocacy at the national college attainment network a non profit group working on behalf of low income and minority students said pursuing a degree that a student didn't have an affinity for simply because it paid well was probably unwise you don't want students to make this decision based on finances alone she said but such information can be useful she said when it comes time to compare financial aid packages if a student is interested in a field that tends to have lower earnings keeping borrowing costs down is important so the amount of grant and scholarship aid a college offers should be weighed carefully when comparing offers from different schools get the st smart parenting

strokes of the cane on friday march 18 in sentencing the 45 year old man a high court judge said this was one of the worst cases of rape and sexual assault and that the accused's actions are deeply horrific and horrendously reprehensible the accused destroyed the cherished values of the victims' sanctuary and turned their home into a living hell said justice tan siong thye in a nearly 70 page judgment he had caused unimaginable misery and untold torment to them for several years the man began sexually assaulting his oldest daughter in 2004 when she was six or seven years old extending his abuse to his other daughters over the years only the youngest of the five girls was spared the trail of abuse was uncovered in november 2018 when one daughter finally made a police report accompanied by an older sister the girl now 16 is the youngest of the four abused girls the man a freelance instructor for children's adventure camp also has two sons he cannot be named to protect the identity of his children last week he pleaded guilty to seven charges for offences committed against his fourth daughter when she was aged 12 to 13 the charges comprise three for aggravated rape one for aggravated sexual assault by penetration two for aggravated outrage of modesty and one for ill treatment of a child another 26 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing the sexual to abuse usually took place at night when the man's wife was out working the accused exploited and took advantage of these opportunities to sexually assault the victim without detection said justice tan adding that this was an aggravating factor the man's use of sexual grooming and threats to satisfy his sexual perversion were also factors that justified severe punishment the judge added when the girl was in primary 5 the man tried to normalise the idea of her having sex with him by showing her a pornographic video which he claimed involved a girl her age having sex with her father in 2018 the man threatened to stop her from schooling if she did not have sex with him every month justice tan also considered the sexual offences committed against the three other abused girls the number and nature of these charges reinforce the need for specific deterrence he said he noted that after the two girls left the flat to make a police report the man went to three police stations to look for them when he could not find them he searched online for ways to pass a lie detector test justice tan also raised an incident in 2015 when one daughter reported the man to the police but he told his wife to persuade the girl to lie to the police he managed to get away with the sexual offences in 2015 and he hoped he could do the same in 2018 the accused was prepared to lie to the police and maintained his innocence until recently when he realised the avalanche of evidence against him the man's guilty plea did not warrant a sentencing discount as it did not appear to be motivated by genuine remorse said the judge justice tan also called the way the man had in september 2018 deprived three daughters and his younger son of food for five days over the small matter of uncompleted chores as deplorable the man threw away all the food in the house including all the raw and frozen food in the refrigerator going to the extent of binding bottles of water in the fridge with rubber bands so he would know if the children tampered with them the children survived on tap water and the occasional meal smuggled to them by other family members justice tan also considered the charges against the man for physically abusing his wife and three children the man caned his wife on the arm in 2007 stepped on the back of one daughter in 2012 kicked another daughter in the stomach in 2014 and punched his younger son in the eye in 2016 these charges when seen in totality paint a disturbing and tragic picture of the physical domination the accused enjoyed over the rest of his family said the judge justice tan added that the victims' impact statements made clear that the sexual abuse has left them with lasting trauma and painful wounds the youngest victim expressed how there were times when she blamed herself that her siblings no longer had a father despite her family's support she could not help but feel that she was fighting this emotional battle alone said the judge the sister who had accompanied her to the police station said that she remained silent about the abuse as she was afraid to break up her family another sister fears ever having a father figure in their home

        "content": "singapore singapore's labour market recovery is expected to be sustained this year as business activities continue to pick up although this could be affected by rising uncertainty in the global economic outlook amid the ongoing russia ukraine conflict the pace of recovery may be more gradual as most significant improvements were already made last year the 2021 labour market report by the ministry of manpower mom on monday march 14 showed domestically the outlook is likely to be uneven across sectors last year total employment excluding migrant domestic workers rebounded by 41 400 after a sharp contraction of 166 600 in 2020 this was due to stronger resident employment growth which rose by 71 300 and more than offset the non resident employment decline of 30 000 the ministry highlighted in the report on monday in the fourth quarter alone total employment went up substantially by 47 900 despite the omicron outbreak the number of non resident workers employed grew for the first time in two years with the gradual easing of covid 19 border curbs on the inflow of foreign labour mom s data showed resident employment trends were mixed while employment grew in sectors such as information and communications health and social services professional services administrative and support services and financial services it fell moderately in accommodation air transport and supporting services and arts entertainment and recreation due to tight travel restrictions for the most part of the year meanwhile non resident employment declined in all sectors except for construction which was boosted by an increase in the fourth quarter with easing border restrictions this decline was due to decreases in the number of employment pass holders by 15 300 and s pass holders by 12 200 the number of work permit and other work pass holders also fell but by a smaller extent of 2 400 the unemployment situation also improved the overall rate fell to 2 7 per cent last year from 3 per cent in 2020 the resident unemployment rate which covers singapore citizens and permanent residents declined to 3 5 per cent from 4 1 per cent previously among citizens this was 3 7 per cent down from 4 2 per cent the unemployment rates in january this year were around those seen in december 2019 according to the report however the average long term unemployment rate among residents which accounts for workers who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more remained elevated at 1 per cent compared with pre covid 19 levels of about 0 7 per cent this was due to structural mismatches that tend to take longer to dissipate mom explained on the retrenchment front there was a significant decline from a high of 26 110 in 2020 to 8 020 last year below pre covid 19 levels a higher proportion of retrenched residents were able to secure employment the annual re entry rate among retrenched residents rose from 62 per cent in 2020 to 66 per cent last year a six year high at the same time hiring and job vacancies have gone up the seasonally adjusted recruitment rate trended higher to 2 5 per cent in the fourth quarter a rate last seen in 2014 the resignation rate also held steady over the quarter at 1 7 per cent slightly below the typical pre covid 19 rate outgoing permanent secretary for manpower aubeck kam said we are not seeing any overall uptick in resignation rates there are of course some sector variants but nothing to suggest that there is anything of concern on that front overall the labour market remained tight with the seasonally adjusted number of job vacancies rising further to 117 100 in december last year the high number of job openings was driven in part by travel restrictions impacting the inflow of migrant workers highlighted the report however with the gradual easing of these restrictions mom expects non resident workforce numbers to improve this year and job vacancies in sectors with heavier reliance on migrant workers to abate this year the outlook for the various sectors will continue to be uneven barring a sharp slowdown in the global economy outward oriented sectors are expected to continue seeing positive growth the information and communications and financial and insurance services in particular can expect healthy growth due to robust demand for it and digital solutions and credit and payment processing services said mom this should provide sustained labour demand in these sectors consumer facing sectors such as food and beverage services and retail trade are projected to benefit from the easing of covid 19 measures as more workers will be needed for the pickup in business activities on the other hand recovery for the tourism and aviation related sectors is expected to be slow on account of the gradual loosening of travel restrictions globally and the nascent recovery in global travel demand said mom employment levels in these sectors may take longer to return to pre covid 19 levels manpower minister tan see leng said he is cautiously optimistic that the labour market will maintain its recovery trajectory despite the increased downside risks in a facebook post on monday dr tan said providing targeted assistance to help businesses and workers remains a key priority for his ministry we will do more to uplift and strengthen support for vulnerable and mature workers he added mr patrick tay assistant secretary general of the national trades union congress said employers will need to brace for a tight labour market by looking for ways to redesign jobs and encourage digitalisation to keep pace with the developments workers too will need to embrace lifelong learning to pick up fresh skills and stay relevant for new or transformed jobs while being resilient to

with its many moving parts new scientific discoveries and constant updates on the various protocols ever wonder how the various ministries and agencies in singapore have kept a strong united front and

deteriorated from being sleep deprived and she had to stop working for six months the customer service officer who wanted to be known only as jessie 37 told the straits times that she decided to throw in the towel and fork out 1 200 to rent a bedroom in a landed house elsewhere with her husband last month as she could not take it anymore spending the money is worth it as it buys me peace i can now sleep properly my blood pressure has gotten better and i can focus on my job now she said jessie who still owns her housing board flat in yishun took her case to the community disputes resolution tribunal cdrt in july 2020 after three failed attempts at mediation through the community mediation centre cmc she claimed her neighbours quietened down for about three weeks after the session before the noise started to pick up again jessie's case was among 221 applications that were filed with the cdrt in 2020 there were 237 applications in 2021 minister for home affairs and law k shanmugam said in response to a parliamentary question on feb 18 hdb has also seen an uptick in feedback relating to noise from residents' activities including renovation noise such cases went up by about 25 per cent to 3 200 cases a month in 2021 compared with 2 500 cases a month in 2020 this is likely due to work from home arrangements coupled with the resumption of renovation activity in june 2020 said national development minister desmond lee in response to a parliamentary question on feb 14 jessie who worked in an office claimed the noises from her neighbour's young children would get worse after 10pm and carried on until past midnight when it stopped noises from pushing furniture would begin the distress from not being able to sleep affected her at work she said i'd go to work and sleep in the office i got quick tempered i started to scold customers and cry at work i couldn't control myself i never behaved like that before and it scared me i couldn't go on like this any longer and i left my job dr annabelle chow principal clinical psychologist at annabelle psychology said noise disturbances could result in poor quality fragmented sleep when a person wakes up several times a night and could affect their mental well being it increases day time sleepiness tiredness annoyance mood changes and decreases cognitive performance she said jessie was also prescribed medication sleeping pills antidepressants and propranolol a medicine that treats high blood pressure anxiety and migraines dr adrian wang a psychiatrist who runs his own practice at gleneagles medical centre said that prescribing medication like antidepressants is not uncommon to regulate anxiety while patients look for a longer term solution mental health is tied to physical health if your sleep is poor and stress levels are high it affects your blood pressure digestive processes and can cause tension headaches or anxiety attacks he added jessie landed a job in the same line which she started when she moved out last month she and her husband are also in the process of selecting a build to order flat which they applied for last november she said of her yishun flat i thought this would be our 'forever home' after renting for about three years before moving in i love this unit and i'm sad i'll likely have to let it go hdb advises those facing neighbour disputes to communicate with your neighbours politely listen to them and be willing to compromise before seeking mediation services according to its website the current quiet hours where residents are advised to keep their volume levels low and avoid carrying out drilling and hammering works are between 10 30pm and 7am a private tuition teacher who wanted to be known only as ms ng 47 said she was polite when she approached her neighbour upstairs to tell them about the alleged heavy footsteps and dragging noises she heard they said i was crazy and shut the door she said adding that the noise which mainly occurs in the day was disruptive but ms ng is hesitant to apply for mediation through the cmc or cdrt to bring the matter up to that level wouldn't it strain relations it's a last resort and i doubt the chances of an effective resolution she said i'll just tolerate it but in another case madam chia 46 said that bringing her issue to cdrt was the only avenue she had as her neighbour upstairs refused to attend mediation and was adamant the stomping and running noises she allegedly heard did not come from their children the neighbour even posted on our estate's facebook group that they were the ones being harassed the customer service officer added the proceedings are still ongoing dr wang advised people enduring noisy neighbours to explain the situation calmly to them if the problem is not solved seek help from authorities to mediate don't take matters into your own hands he said in a letter to st's forum page published on feb 21 an st reader suggested a demerit system for recalcitrant noisy neighbours where hdb compiles complaints from residents about a specific unit hdb should issue the unit a warning letter when the complaints reach a certain number the reader said adding that the number of warning letters should be considered when the noise maker applies for another flat or for services under hdb in the united kingdom noisy residents can be issued a noise abatement order if they break the order they can be fined up to 5 000 s 9 000 but criminal lawyer amolat singh said the demerit system is not workable as it may punish innocent residents living in the same home if it's up to the number of complaints there is no avenue for a person to clear their name he said mr singh noted that offenders who contravenes a magistrate's court order to abate the nuisance can face a fine of up to 2 000 under the miscellaneous offences public order and nuisance act but these are extreme cases the remedy lies in educating people we are a very densely populated country and we have to be a bit more sensitive he added still jessie hopes more can be done she said there are many people who are in the same situation i was in and we complain and give advice to each other on social media others may not have the means to move out like i did so i really hope the government can do more about this join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and

        "content": "singapore the housing board has adjusted its plans for two upcoming developments and is studying if it can modify plans for a third following environmental studies and consultations with nature groups in a statement to the straits times last month hdb said that where possible it has incorporated the recommendations proposed by environmental studies in its review of development plans for woodlands north and miltonia close in yishun these studies conducted by third parties were commissioned by the board the board received 96 responses during a call for public feedback on the various studies including two conducted on areas in tengah it has also taken into consideration the wider ecological connectivity of the areas in line with the national parks board's nparks ongoing ecological profiling exercise which seeks to map paths that wildlife take between singapore's green patches improving connectivity between these plots increases access to food for wildlife and helps them find mates reducing the odds of inbreeding hdb's updated plans include retaining an entire 4 39ha core conservation area identified in a study on woodlands north and also preserving a 6 4ha area in miltonia close which forms the majority of a core biodiversity area established through a study separately hdb said that along with nparks and other agencies it is studying the possibility of conserving all recommended areas of conservation identified by studies on tengah north and south this may include areas in addition to about 140ha of green spaces that have already been set aside for the upcoming 700ha town in the urban redevelopment authority's ura master plan hdb's updates follow the revision of plans for dover forest announced last july when it said that half of the forest will be developed for housing and the other half set aside to preserve its biodiversity after scientific studies and nature enthusiasts flagged its conservation value for woodlands north hdb will carve out part of a site presently zoned for residential use to be a green space instead this allows it to retain an entire core conservation area of 4 39ha in its future developments based on recommendations by environmental studies about three quarters of the conservation area is currently part of admiralty park which will be extended to keep the entire conservation area intact to make up for the shortfall in housing land caused by the park's extension a 1 39ha plot of managed vegetation that now lies in the park towards the north of the future housing area will be converted for residential use dr shawn lum a botanist at nanyang technological university said the woodlands north site is not far from but not directly connected to other nature areas yet it has somehow managed to retain and harbour a rich variety of plant species including some that are incredibly rare even in singapore's nature reserves said dr lum who is also the nature society singapore president the conservation area also contains a section of original freshwater swamp forest the rarest of all habitats in singapore and southern johor dr lum added it is a small pocket and a bit degraded but it has some incredibly rare plants in it such as the neesia malayana which was until recently thought to have become locally extinct he said adding that he was concerned that the environmental study report published by hdb did not account for the ecological value of the site in comparison with the wider landscape he suggested that the conservation area's ecological value be enhanced by retaining or creating pockets of forest vegetation in the residential area adjacent to it and this will also help to cool the built up area hdb said that for sites earmarked for development natural elements will be preserved and integrated within developments where possible to strengthen ecological connectivity the 6 4ha plot in miltonia close that hdb plans to retain as a nature park is 2 times the size of the original park space budgeted for in the ura master plan it will include a natural stream and riparian habitats that exist alongside it which support species such as the critically endangered red tailed pipe snake and the endangered buffy fish owl keeping the plot means the authorities have moved other planned developments out of the miltonia close site which is earmarked for public and private housing an education institution that was to be in the area will now be housed elsewhere in yishun hdb said the park will provide nature based recreation opportunities for residents and safeguard ecological connectivity along lower seletar reservoir located to the park's east between the central catchment area and khatib bongsu it plans to move wildlife located outside the planned nature park into it where possible these include young saplings of plant species that have conservation significance and bats from a roosting site that will not be retained hdb said its plans for miltonia close are subject to further study dr lum said the retained site can play a critical role in habitat connectivity in the area and has strong potential for habitat restoration and enhancement the plans manage to strike a good balance between meeting housing and infrastructure needs while maintaining as best as possible the ecological integrity of the area he said meanwhile for developments in tengah north hdb and other agencies are assessing the feasibility of retaining a 100m wide green corridor along bukit batok road this will help enhance the town's ecological connectivity to the central catchment area through bukit batok nature corridor to its east commenting on the process that led to hdb adjusting its plans dr lum said the process of planning consulting gathering public as well as targeted feedback and refining plans based on this feedback leads to better outcomes on all fronts not just for nature biodiversity he added the earlier in the planning process takes place the

with neurodevelopmental disorders or from disadvantaged backgrounds may be unable to keep up and end up falling through the cracks ms jane sum research assistant at the nus yong loo lin school of medicine s yllsom centre for holistic initiatives for learning development child remembers her encounter with a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder asd while volunteering at pathlight school in 2016 the boy started talking to her excitedly about mrt stations in singapore and asked if she knew what station ew16 ne3 was ms sum did not know the answer but the boy quickly informed her that it was outram park and went on to list all the different mrt stations on the east west line station after station it was such an amazing encounter with a child with such a great memory the experience struck a chord with me and after that i became more curious about the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with the brain and the neuroscience behind it after her a levels ms sum initially wanted to pursue psychology in an overseas university in australia or in the united kingdom uk but a friend told her about the psychology programme in james cook university s jcu singapore campus i did further research on the school and was attracted by the pedagogy it offered i also liked that it is also accredited by the australian psychology accreditation council she shares she enrolled in the bachelors of psychological science honours course in 2017 and graduated in 2020 now 26 she is using what she learnt to build a more inclusive learning environment for children with learning difficulties at child her key project is developing a school readiness assessment to screen preschoolers aged four to six years old it features an algorithm that helps to identify children at risk of developmental learning and behavioural delays in early childhood particularly when brain plasticity is the most favourable the assessment consists of a set of questions and tasks to measure children's general knowledge executive functioning a set of mental skills that include working memory flexible thinking and self control social emotional and learning skills ms sum s team is looking into deploying user friendly technology and machine learning to help capture the child's learning profiles more efficiently and accurately getting better at identifying children who are at risk of learning and behavioural challenges will help address social disparities to inform better early childhood education strategies it will also help to manage resources efficiently and facilitate policy planning in education and healthcare she explains ms sum is also developing a cognitive training intervention programme that trains children on executive function skills such as to sustain attention plan remember information exercise self control and to manage multiple tasks successfully studies have shown that these skills are crucial for the child s learning and development and contribute largely to their success in school achievement and emotional regulation skills through these new programmes ms sum hopes to raise greater awareness and collaboration among teachers parents specialists and agencies to help young children prepare for the rigours of school life i am interested to see how current innovations and technology can be implemented to boost children s mental skills these will help to shape a more inclusive learning environment in singapore she says ms sum loves that her job at the yllsom allows her to experience both the research and clinical side of child psychology as a research assistant ms sum s role also involves data analysis data collection designing of research projects and writing of academic articles she gathers and analyses research data with a team made up of clinicians psychologists and researchers the statistical skills that she picked up throughout her time in jcu have given her an added advantage when dealing with statistics at work the skills and lessons were thoughtfully catered to my learning needs and are highly transferable to my current job which prepared me well with the statistical knowledge required to do various analyses for our research project in my lab ms sum says the development and validation of the new school readiness screening assessment also requires her to meet teachers and children to better understand learning needs in preschool settings since yllsom is also part of the national university health system nuhs she also gets to shadow a psychologist and a paediatrician to learn more about cognitive and behavioural difficulties children face furthermore the exposure helps her to frame research questions from a clinical perspective all in all ms sum highly recommends jcu s psychology courses to future students there are many areas of psychology to explore be it in healthcare business or community settings if you are interested in the hows and whys of human behaviour psychology will be a great area

        "content": "singapore increasing places for adult learners would help shift mindsets about education and create a pathway for singaporeans to upgrade their skills for new jobs and fill existing roles experts said take for instance ms nadia daeng 39 after 18 years in the workforce she is looking to go back to school to get a degree she graduated from ngee ann polytechnic with a diploma in mass communications in 2004 and has been working in communications and advocacy for caregivers since then she told the straits times a university degree was on my list of things to do when i was growing up now i'm interested in psychology related degree courses to help me understand my strengths better and identify personality traits in others so i'll know how to contribute to a more productive and healthy work environment for future jobs in the next stage of my career opportunities for more working adults like her to get subsidised places at universities here are now on the cards on march 7 education minister chan chun sing announced that the ministry of education moe would study the possibility of a higher lifetime cohort participation rate in education this means moe is considering allowing more working adults to get places in government funded degree programmes mr chan said while presenting his ministry's budget in parliament singapore human resources institute president low peck kem told st that moe's shift to a lifetime cohort participation rate is a step in the right direction to encouraging lifelong learning she said increasing subsidised places for adult learners will create a structured way for workers to upgrade alongside other avenues like trade certification dr kelvin seah from the department of economics at national university of singapore nus said while the policy will result in more graduates an increase in the supply of graduates in the labour market may not result in lower salaries for them he said it is possible that there will also be an increase in the demand for skilled labour if international companies looking to hire high skilled labour are attracted to singapore as a result of the increased supply of graduates the end result on singapore's labour market is therefore ambiguous at this point since there would be both an increase in the supply of graduates as well as a possible increase in the demand for them associate professor terence ho from the nus lee kuan yew school of public policy said there are many professional managerial and executive pme roles in the labour market which singaporeans can take up if they have the relevant skills he added that what is more important than the absolute number of degree holders is how well they are prepared for the needs of companies and the future economy he said increasing the number of subsidised places for adult learners could increase the supply of graduates with an appropriate skills match for existing and newly created jobs in growth sectors particularly as the economy transforms in its labour market report for 2021 released on monday march 14 the ministry of manpower mom said 117 100 job vacancies were available last december but in order for working adults to be able to go back to school arrangements must be made for their tight schedules and other commitments said baby product company owner lin daoyang 42 mr lin told st that while he got an engineering degree from nus in 2005 he would like to go back for short modular courses in either engineering or an unrelated field like astrophysics to keep up with the latest technology and for his personal interests mr lin who has three schoolgoing children said working adults have a lot to juggle with kids and work commitments right now the system is you either get a degree or nothing at all from a university there should be another way where you can stack modules and maybe get a certificate mr ben breen managing director for asia pacific and global head of construction at us non profit project management institute pmi said that courses must be designed differently for working adults and full time students pmi has conducted project management courses and awarded professional certificates since 1984 mr breen added there are many factors that go into creation of the course materials based on the audience type adult education should allow for some flexibility as they juggle between many roles making online on demand courses a preferred option work is in progress to bring these changes to singapore's education system in parliament mr chan also said singapore's institutes of higher learning which include the six autonomous universities five polytechnics and the institute of technical education must review their programmes with adult learners in mind join st's telegram

        "content": "singapore the debate on relying on the goods and services tax gst hike versus counting on other mechanisms to generate revenue misses the point said finance minister lawrence wong during a post budget roundtable organised by the straits times and the business times on monday march 14 the gst increase needs to be considered together with other options he added as spending needs go up and the funding gap increases the minister said the gst hike alone does not yield enough revenue for the government to address that funding gap during the discussion which was moderated by straits times associate editor vikram khanna mr wong also elaborated on why certain other methods to generate revenue were not chosen such as increasing personal income tax corporate tax or introducing estate tax in his budget speech on feb 18 mr wong had announced that the planned goods and services tax hike would be delayed and the rate would be increased by one percentage point each year in 2023 and 2024 when asked on monday if the finance ministry had considered alternative measures mr wong said it's certainly a question i've had to deal with a lot after the budget and i've consistently told everyone we've considered all of these alternatives he noted that current expenditure is about 18 per cent of gross domestic product gdp and is expected to increase to 20 per cent of gdp or more by 2030 while 2 per cent of gdp may sound like a small figure it is about 10 billion in absolute numbers using current gdp figures he said adding that the gst rate increase will yield only about 3 5 billion a year if instead of the gst rate increase the task of generating more revenue was placed on personal or corporate income tax it would be unbearable said mr wong it would also have a huge impact on singapore's overall competitiveness in addition increasing personal income taxes would mean the middle or upper middle income groups would have to pay more as a small group of top earners are unlikely to bear the entire load he said another common objection to the gst increase that it will hurt the poor is also not valid because of the enhanced gst voucher scheme which will effectively neutralise the impact of the tax increase on low income groups said mr wong when asked by mr khanna if the threshold at which gst can be charged by companies could be lowered to broaden the tax base mr wong said it was a judgment call to balance between revenue needs and compliance costs especially for smaller businesses singapore's threshold is currently at an annual turnover of 1 million while some other countries have set a lower bar for example in malaysia it is at rm500 000 s 163 000 mr wong added with all the changes that are happening already the cost increases the impact of supply chains the cost of raw materials smaller businesses are the ones that are hurting the most so if we were to impose this on them they would be the ones to suffer fellow round table panellist ng chee meng secretary general of the national trades union congress added that apart from the collection of taxes it is important to remember the distribution of the tax dollars the monies go to areas such as eldercare and education which contribute to building an inclusive society he said mr wong agreed saying that singapore pays attention to both fronts taxation in a fair and effective way and expenditure in ensuring good value for money outcomes and that those with greater needs get more so when you add the two together we in fact have a highly progressive system of taxes and transfers compared to most other countries he said the panellists which also included uob head of research suan teck kin and national university of singapore economics finance and real estate professor sumit agarwal also discussed the tax rates of other countries for example in the united kingdom the maximum personal income tax rate is 45 per cent while its standard tax on goods and services is 20 per cent in many organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries the value added tax vat rates are in the double digits such as japan's 10 per cent in response mr wong said so we really should be asking ourselves why would singapore be so special and these countries also have very high income tax rates easily way above 30 per cent for the middle income we're not talking about the top tier so why would we somehow think that singapore would be so different on the topic of estate duties mr wong said singapore's experience was that a disproportionate part of the burden was borne by the middle and upper middle income groups whereas the very top end could tax plan estate duties away this poses a similar challenge as a net wealth tax which has been suggested as an alternative method for revenue generation there is no solution in sight yet to address this challenge said mr wong he added we continue to study we continue to review and look at the experiences of other jurisdictions we also do not rule out that perhaps international rules may evolve around this just as they have on corporate taxes mr khanna also asked about property taxes another key measure from the budget noting that while the increase in property tax would bring in significant revenue it may not tame the property market because the super rich would not be deterred so property prices may continue to rise and if that happens the wealth inequalities will continue to widen said mr khanna in response mr wong said the property tax regime is not meant to cool the property market as there are other tools for that including moves such as higher additional buyer's stamp duty rates that were announced in december 2021 with regard to dealing with wealth inequality ideally we would like to tax wealth directly in the form of a net wealth tax he said but that is in practice very hard to implement which is why many oecd countries have also dropped the idea of a net wealth tax the ministry will continue to review and study this mr wong added join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel

        "content": "singapore what china decides to do about the war in ukraine could affect the future world order and he hopes beijing will assert its enormous influence on russia to help put an end to the conflict said foreign minister vivian balakrishnan speaking to bloomberg on tuesday march 15 dr balakrishnan said china has a far bigger stake than russia in an integrated multilateral rules based world china has enormous influence on russia both politically economically and diplomatically he said in a transcript of the interview released on wednesday by the ministry of foreign affairs i hope they will assert their influence in the usual way with chinese characteristics which means quietly discreetly but effectively that is a hope whether this is wishful thinking on my part we will see over the next few days and weeks russia's feb 24 invasion of ukraine has been described by politicians and commentators as a watershed moment that could upend the international order established after world war ii dr balakrishnan said in the interview for bloomberg's 7th asean business summit that the war was perhaps even a bigger moment than the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 which could create a bifurcated world that would experience slower progress inflation less interdependence and more conflict what china does will be absolutely crucial to the new world order that is emerging he added and noted that china has doubled down on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty and has shown some discomfort with the invasion of ukraine the big 'if' now is what decisions and actions china takes said dr balakrishnan if you get the deepening of the bifurcation of the global economy of supply chains of technology this will be a very very different world on how the war might play out dr balakrishnan said the likely scenario is a protracted quagmire for russia with some form of frozen conflict with lines of control and a rump state but probably decades of instability meanwhile the most dangerous outcome is an escalation leading to the deployment of nuclear weapons which would be an absolute disaster for the world he said the best possible outcome is that cool heads prevail and china and the us and everyone else can facilitate dialogue and negotiations and save lives he added noting that this seemed like a remote prospect about which he was not optimistic at this point in time last month singapore made the rare move of joining a growing list of countries around the world that have imposed sanctions on russia the republic has seldom imposed unilateral sanctions in the absence of binding united nations security council decisions or direction dr balakrishnan said singapore took the step because the invasion was egregious and involved a permanent member of the un security council russia's actions set a dangerous precedent for big countries to trample over the concepts of territorial integrity sovereignty and independence to invade a smaller neighbour in abrogation of international laws he added we felt this is a time that we have to take a stand not because we are taking sides but because these principles are existential for a tiny city state he said with the world at an inflection point little singapore is standing up for principles and expressing a hope for the rules of engagement for this new era he added singapore and its neighbours have also been key beneficiaries of the open and inclusive political and economic architecture that have allowed for economic integration free trade and the flow of capital noted dr balakrishnan adding that south east asia as a whole hopes to keep the region open to all superpowers we are not looking for one or the other or to play games he said the worst possible outcome is to be an arena for proxy wars and superpower contestations we have no intention of taking sides and being a cat's paw or being a vassal state for one or the other asked if he was satisfied with asean's statement on the invasion which did not mention russia explicitly the foreign minister said he was frankly pleasantly surprised with the agreement on the key points of territorial integrity and sovereignty and the gravity of the situation in ukraine given the diversity within the 10 nation bloc the fact that we have gotten so far to me is very encouraging it shows that we have consensus on what is really important and we are able to express ourselves and take a stand he said dr balakrishnan also dismissed the idea of a security focused indo pacific nato akin to the north atlantic treaty organisation that some have suggested the united states is trying to build in the region asean is meant to be an open inclusive association focused on trade economic integration inclusive and

        "content": "singapore a man who sexually abused four of his five daughters over a 14 year period raping three of them was sentenced to a jail term of 33 years and two months and given 24 strokes of the cane on friday march 18 in sentencing the 45 year old man a high court judge said this was one of the worst cases of rape and sexual assault and that the accused's actions are deeply horrific and horrendously reprehensible the accused destroyed the cherished values of the victims' sanctuary and turned their home into a living hell said justice tan siong thye in a nearly 70 page judgment he had caused unimaginable misery and untold torment to them for several years the man began sexually assaulting his oldest daughter in 2004 when she was six or seven years old extending his abuse to his other daughters over the years only the youngest of the five girls was spared the trail of abuse was uncovered in november 2018 when one daughter finally made a police report accompanied by an older sister the girl now 16 is the youngest of the four abused girls the man a freelance instructor for children's adventure camp also has two sons he cannot be named to protect the identity of his children last week he pleaded guilty to seven charges for offences committed against his fourth daughter when she was aged 12 to 13 the charges comprise three for aggravated rape one for aggravated sexual assault by penetration two for aggravated outrage of modesty and one for ill treatment of a child another 26 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing the sexual to abuse usually took place at night when the man's wife was out working the accused exploited and took advantage of these opportunities to sexually assault the victim without detection said justice tan adding that this was an aggravating factor the man's use of sexual grooming and threats to satisfy his sexual perversion were also factors that justified severe punishment the judge added when the girl was in primary 5 the man tried to normalise the idea of her having sex with him by showing her a pornographic video which he claimed involved a girl her age having sex with her father in 2018 the man threatened to stop her from schooling if she did not have sex with him every month justice tan also considered the sexual offences committed against the three other abused girls the number and nature of these charges reinforce the need for specific deterrence he said he noted that after the two girls left the flat to make a police report the man went to three police stations to look for them when he could not find them he searched online for ways to pass a lie detector test justice tan also raised an incident in 2015 when one daughter reported the man to the police but he told his wife to persuade the girl to lie to the police he managed to get away with the sexual offences in 2015 and he hoped he could do the same in 2018 the accused was prepared to lie to the police and maintained his innocence until recently when he realised the avalanche of evidence against him the man's guilty plea did not warrant a sentencing discount as it did not appear to be motivated by genuine remorse said the judge justice tan also called the way the man had in september 2018 deprived three daughters and his younger son of food for five days over the small matter of uncompleted chores as deplorable the man threw away all the food in the house including all the raw and frozen food in the refrigerator going to the extent of binding bottles of water in the fridge with rubber bands so he would know if the children tampered with them the children survived on tap water and the occasional meal smuggled to them by other family members justice tan also considered the charges against the man for physically abusing his wife and three children the man caned his wife on the arm in 2007 stepped on the back of one daughter in 2012 kicked another daughter in the stomach in 2014 and punched his younger son in the eye in 2016 these charges when seen in totality paint a disturbing and tragic picture of the physical domination the accused enjoyed over the rest of his family said the judge justice tan added that the victims' impact statements made clear that the sexual abuse has left them with lasting trauma and painful wounds the youngest victim expressed how there were times when she blamed herself that her siblings no longer had a father despite her family's support she could not help but feel that she was fighting this emotional battle alone said the judge the sister who had accompanied her to the police station said that she remained silent about the abuse as she was afraid to break up her family another sister fears ever having a father figure in their home

        "content": "singapore the events food and beverage and hospitality sectors among the worst hit by the covid 19 pandemic applauded streamlined covid 19 measures that kicked in on tuesday march 15 but the recovery of these sectors will be limited unless measures ease further said industry insiders changes like lifting specific attendance limits for events with fewer than 1 000 people and removing zoning requirements lower the costs of organising events said mr edward liu managing director of events organiser conference and exhibition management services without the constraints we could save on hiring more temporary staff to man the zones within exhibition halls and the deployment of safe distancing ambassadors he said mr dylan sharma vice president of advocacy and communications at the singapore association of convention and exhibition organisers and suppliers said the meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions mice industry welcomed the streamlining but recovery remains an ongoing journey as we move towards an endemic covid 19 scaling up business capacities to where it was pre pandemic is not so straightforward said mr sharma citing the loss of talent to other industries as many pandemic hit companies scaled back he also said the streamlining is relatively clear around social distancing requirements in settings with and without mask wearing but he added there is a grey area as many events involve both components yet what is allowed at an event is based on the strictest regulations that apply this means events management companies and organisers have their hands tied when it comes to organising events longer than half a day for instance he said it is almost impossible to hold conferences that last for a full day or multiple days without catered food yet catering would mean the rest of the event has to adhere to stricter social distancing rules even when masks are worn outside meal times similar concerns were raised by ms margaret heng executive director of the singapore hotel association sha she said the 160 member hotels of sha hope rules for food and beverage services during business events can be less stringent ms heng said to expedite the industry's recovery we should now address the need to improve revenue contribution from the banqueting and catering segment with the recent streamlining of safe management measures we have seen only a marginal increase in demand especially for smaller event venues she added ideally we will soon be allowed to host larger table sizes beyond five persons to drive more food and beverage revenue for restaurants and event spaces food and beverage industry insiders are also clamouring for an increase in the maximum size of dining groups allowed a spokesman for the restaurant association of singapore said it hopes eight vaccinated people could dine at food and beverage outlets much sooner than later noting that the utilisation of intensive care unit icu beds and number of severe cases in singapore are well under control the only way this streamlining affects the industry is it encourages people to go to houses there has been a drop in inquiries of 15 per cent to 20 per cent as people have been encouraged to entertain at home with multiple groups said chef and restaurateur dave pynt referring to the maximum number of household visitors being eased to five people at a time from five per day he hopes that the 10 30pm limit on serving alcohol to patrons and the need to check in and out on tracetogether among other measures can be lifted this would be much appreciated by the community and the industry now that 95 per cent of the population is vaccinated and with an infection growth rate of under one for over a week and fewer than 30 people in icu he said he added that prolonged restrictions on the industry have prompted him to scrap plans for a new establishment in downtown singapore in favour of an undecided location overseas some medical experts said measures can be eased further without placing more pressure on hospitals i think the social needs of people aren't really going to be satisfied with five people allowed at home at one time and i'm not sure having 10 vaccinated people is really going to destroy hospitals said professor dale fisher senior infectious diseases consultant at the national university hospital in a roundtable discussion organised by the straits times on tuesday we're a species that needs to socialise we're a species that needs to work to provide for our families and to provide for our recreation he said how religious worship is undertaken has also changed with the streamlining of safety measures the catholic community can now make bookings to attend mass at any church rather than the church they are registered with we are also actively looking into increasing the seating capacities of our churches to accommodate more people during masses while still ensuring that our churches continue to be vigilant in enforcing safety measures currently in place said the archbishop's communications office from the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore venerable seck kwang phing president of the singapore buddhist federation said the streamlining which lifted event size limits for religious services means prayer halls can accommodate more devotees to chant together as the halls are small and there was zoning and social distancing some worshippers have tried to make bookings and failed many times larger temples that could have accommodated more devotees under the streamlined rules which permit a maximum capacity of 50 per cent for events with more than 1 000 people have still capped the number of people attending prayer sessions at 1 000 as a precaution against infecting the vulnerable he added but some of the industry insiders st spoke to said it is too early to gauge the effect of the streamlining on their industries while the food and beverage sales figures in december 2021 and january 2022 grew between 17 per cent and 20 per cent as compared with november 2021 figures the recovery still remains to be seen as december and january are typically the festive months of christmas chinese new year and school holidays said the restaurant association spokesman likewise for the events industry where there is a gestation period of six to 12 months for a business event said mr sharma any streamlining of measures that takes place today really serves to catalyse planning for the long term we are not going to see results from april or may but september onwards he said

        "content": "singapore a committee has been reconvened to address concerns that businesses could use the goods and services tax gst as a cover to raise prices the 13 member committee against profiteering cap will look into feedback on unjustified price increases of essential products and services and focus on daily items commonly consumed or used by singaporean households such as eggs and chicken chaired by minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling the committee held its first meeting on wednesday march 16 its other members include representatives from different industries grassroots organisations and mps the cap will keep a very close watch on the prices of our essential goods and services daily necessities and groceries ms low told reporters after the meeting the committee will review and investigate feedback on unjustified price increases that use gst as a reason and may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer on the pretext of the gst increase she added finance minister lawrence wong had announced that the committee would be formed during his budget speech in february when he set out how singapore's gst rate will increase from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in two stages by one percentage point each time on jan 1 2023 and jan 1 2024 the committee was first set up in 1994 the year gst was first introduced and reconvened during previous rounds of gst increases in 2003 and 2007 like before the reconvened committee will guard against profiteering on essential food items such as eggs chicken and vegetables and meals from hawker centres and coffee shops as well as non food essentials like household products ms low said that the reason why the committee is set up about nine months before the gst hike is to assure members of the public that we will take a whole of government approach in fact take a whole of society approach to look into egregious cases unjustified price increase using the gst increase as a reason and that is a very important signal at the same time she noted that we are in a very complex situation compared with 2007 as businesses are facing cost pressures and some sectors are facing more severe pressure than other sectors due to the nature of their sector ms low said that the ministry of trade and industry will spare no efforts to support those sectors and the companies whether it is retail or food and beverages citing the support rolled out in budget 2022 such as the 70 million food services and retail business revitalisation package and the small business recovery grant with the help of businesses and members of the public we will be able to uphold healthy market competition for the benefit of the market and society she added on how the committee is going to decide the perimeters of whether a business is justified in raising its prices ms low said in general our businesses are honest and transparent in their pricing and they should continue to do so cap's role is to strengthen transparency in pricing to enable free market competition to function as it should she added so genuine and honest businesses have nothing to worry about she said asked how the essential items will be chosen ms low noted that the singapore department of statistics compiles the consumer price index based on a basket of goods and services so we are using that mechanism to monitor closely the prices of our essential goods and services groceries and daily necessities she said ms low noted that the committee received about 200 pieces of feedback from the public between 2007 and 2009 about 90 per cent of them were related to the food and beverage and retail sectors back then cap would work with partners like the people's association pa and the consumers association of singapore case to look into public feedback about price hikes she noted in many of the cases the merchants actually agreed to explain why it's necessary for them to make the price adjustment and in some cases the merchants and the hawkers actually deferred the price increase she added out of the 200 feedback ms low said the cap made public one case in 2007 a student care centre had been reprimanded for excessive fee increase the centre which was not named had announced to parents in its newsletter that due to the gst hike from 5 per cent to 7 per cent it would be raising its fees from 270 to 280 across its branches the 10 difference was nearly twice the additional amount of 5 40 that parents had to pay for the gst hike on whether there is a timeframe for the cap to take action or conduct further investigations after a feedback has been filed ms low said it could vary depending on the feedback some members of the committee said they are glad to be part of the cap and to keep a lookout for consumers' interest mr hong poh hin vice chairman of the foochow coffee restaurant and bar merchants association which represents more than 400 coffee shops said businesses can adjust their prices but when they adjust their prices they must be transparent it can't be that because the gst goes up by 1 per cent then they increase their prices by a lot said mr hong meanwhile radin mas mp and case president melvin yong said case is happy to support the national effort to address consumers' concerns of profiteering and unjustified price increases under the cover of gst we are mindful that some businesses may take this opportunity to raise prices without justification we must therefore send a strong signal that profiteering and unjustified price increases disguised under the pretext of gst cannot be tolerated he said singapore retailers association president r dhinakaran said that educating businesses on cap's role will be done as this can help prevent profiteering in this way firms will not do any of the profiteering because of the gst because they know the gst is tax neutral that means what they collect from the consumers they will have to pay to iras inland revenue authority of singapore he said consumers told the straits times that they welcomed the reconvening of the committee to ensure that their interests are taken care of administrative manager siti ali 40 said singaporeans have to carry the impact when the gst hike takes place in the next two years by having this committee they will help in becoming like a gatekeeper to strike a balance between understanding the needs of consumers and businesses she said members of the public who wish to report unjustified price hikes using the gst increase as an excuse can do so at this website from april 1

supermarket chain fairprice will find that the familiar markings on the floor to space out the checkout lines have not been removed fairprice is sticking to the safe distancing measures even though it is not required to do so fairprice is maintaining existing safe management measures to encourage safe social practices on our premises nonetheless we continue to monitor the ever evolving situation said a spokesman under streamlined measures which kicked in on tuesday safe distancing is encouraged but not compulsory for mask on activities such as grocery shopping attending worship sessions and visiting singapore's parks social distancing markers at common spaces in parks like those in shelters at east coast park have been removed camping sites and barbecue pits managed by the national parks board nparks will also be reopened from friday subject to bookings said mr chia seng jiang group director for parks at nparks nonetheless he encouraged campers and barbecue pit users to observe safe management measures such as wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercise or consuming food drink or medication as well as observing a safe distance of at least 1m from other visitors meanwhile booking is no longer required to visit tanjong palawan and siloso beaches at sentosa for entry or to use the beach courts there on weekends and public holidays guests can therefore enjoy sentosa's beaches daily without bookings said sentosa development corporation sdc in a statement on monday adding that safety rings will remain at the beaches indicating spots where groups of up to five may gather while it is not mandatory for our guests to use the safety rings they serve as a visual marker to encourage safe distancing said an sdc spokesman to avoid overcrowding at any area on the beaches beachgoers may be directed to another area if necessary safe distancing measures will no longer be in place in mosques from thursday said the islamic religious council of singapore muis on facebook on monday we are pleased to announce that we are able to make adjustments to safe distancing for congregational prayers in mosques muis said moving forward we will open up more spaces at

able to accommodate a higher number of visitors with the new guidelines announced for the upcoming qing ming the monastery will continue to take a stringent approach and err on the side of caution with crowd control measures these measures include having time slots with a maximum of 900 devotees per hour with the extended operation hours the total estimated capacity for the entire qing ming period is roughly 260 000 almost on par with pre pandemic numbers she said noting that the monastery would see about 250 000 visitors each qing ming season before the pandemic reverend dominic yeo lead pastor at trinity christian centre said the church will not implement the changes immediately we are taking the next few weeks to recalibrate our operations to be ready to welcome more people from the first week of april he added our experience confirms that the online platform cannot replace face to face interaction and community life engineer samuel lim 65 said he was not concerned about the lack of social distancing between individuals wearing masks mr lim who was at bishan ang mo kio park said if you ask me two or five eating together at a table is about the same thing it's a matter of time before covid 19 becomes a way of life i would think this is a good time to move on but i would be a little worried for those who are weak ms han wen 33 who works as a barista at parkway parade said that she would not invite friends over to her home unnecessarily even though the streamlining also entails allowing five household visitors at any one time rather than five a day so i think on a personal level the impact isn't very big but the impact will be on society's covid 19 cases i don't think there will be much changes to my daily life in a facebook post on tuesday evening health minister ong ye kung described how the streamlining would bring people closer together both for work and in their personal lives he said the ministry held its weekly staff meeting on tuesday morning today the streamlined safe management measures smm 1 5 come into force at moh we held our weekly staff meeting in although it still adopted a hybrid format with half the senior staff physically present and the other half logged on via skype those in the room could finally be seated close to one another around a table our masks need to be on but we could hear each other clearly look at one another s expression through the eyes he added many other little things in life can now resume you can take a proper selfie without everyone trying to stand far apart you can sit next to your friend on a park bench you can pack lunch to eat with a colleague in the office pantry and we can start to play team sports yet the key measures that help manage the pandemic masking group size control vaccinations remain firmly in place he said nevertheless today marks an important psychological shift in this long fight against covid 19 as cases continue to fall and the situation in hospitals gradually improves normal life will resume further the streamlined measures also apply to team sports some of which are now finally able to resume in full new guidelines allow for up to 30 fully vaccinated persons to participate in activities at selected sports facilities the list of approved private facilities is still being finalised while public sports facilities that can accommodate the new measures received bookings for team sports such as 5 a side football on tuesday night there were none for activities that featured more than 10 participants such as the full 11 a side game of

noodles or bee hoon with four pieces of yong tau fu for 3 they will go up to 3 50 madam lee is one of the 38 hawkers the straits times spoke to about how the russia ukraine crisis and inflation have impacted their business seventeen of them said they will consider reviewing their food prices if supply costs and overheads continue to rise madam lee said prices of ingredients have been creeping up over the past year for instance the cost of a 18kg tin of vegetable cooking oil is now 50 from 35 in march last year she said i use three tins of vegetable cooking oil a week at my stall so i spend about 150 on cooking oil per week if i don't increase my food prices soon it would be quite hard for me to sustain my profits mr lee yong wen 30 who runs mr meepok at a coffee shop in clementi west is also reviewing prices at his stall after the electricity bill rose by more than 1 000 last month the prices for many things like eggs have been increasing in the past weeks and are set to increase more in future the inflation definitely hit us badly he added in january singapore's core inflation rose to 2 4 per cent year on year the highest since september 2012 food prices have been rising due to the covid 19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and increasing energy prices the situation is now exacerbated by the russia ukraine crisis which has pushed up prices in commodity markets russia and ukraine are vital suppliers of grains vegetable oil and fertilisers which means that supply disruptions will be felt all over the world food prices worldwide hit a record high in february jumping 20 7 per cent from a year earlier led by a surge in the costs of vegetable oils and dairy products the impact of rising food costs and the russia ukraine crisis have slowly trickled down to hawkers ten of the hawkers told st they had raised their prices recently a drink stall operator who wants to be known as mr lim increased hot drink prices by 10 cents in march he said his suppliers began raising prices in december last year mr lim 52 who owns tou shou di drink stall at chinatown complex food centre said i can absorb the initial price increase but the prices keep rising and i can't afford to do that anymore even after my price increase i am still losing about 10 cents for each cup of coffee or tea that i sell if the war in ukraine and russia continues the prices will keep increasing mr anthony low 53 chairman of the federation of merchants' association hawker division said the cost of ingredients and electricity bills have affected hawkers greatly when we add all these up it becomes a heavy burden for hawkers to maintain their current food prices we are selling at affordable prices for the public but with inflation it is hard for us to bear the costs so we have to increase our food prices or else we can't cope mr thya boon hin 56 chairman of the marine parade merchants' association which oversees 84 marine parade central market and food centre and 50a marine terrace market and food centre said some hawkers have been adjusting their prices since january together the two markets have a total of 79 hawker stalls some hawkers increased their prices by 30 cents to 50 cents as the costs of their ingredients oil and electricity have increased in recent months he added despite the rising costs some hawkers such as mr zhang ah seng 54 who runs ah seng bak chor mee in albert food centre did not increase their prices mr zhang is one of 11 hawkers st spoke to who did not raise prices if a small business were to increase prices by a small 50 cents there will be backlash from our regulars and directly affect our business negatively we choose to not increase food prices mainly because of lower wage customers who are already scrimping to survive every day said mr zhang others such as mr david lim 30 owner of ah tas muffins at old airport road food centre said they will try to maintain prices however mr lim said profits will fall as prices of ingredients such as butter chocolate and milk are constantly on the rise with the pending goods and services tax hike we have to pay our landlord and food suppliers more the salary for employees will also have to be increased due to the rising cost of living he added mr hong poh hin vice chairman of the foochow coffee restaurant and bar merchants association which represents more than 400 coffee shops said if the food suppliers increase their prices and the coffee shop operators and stall holders cannot absorb the costs they will pass the cost to the consumers sooner or later most consumers said they

        "content": "singapore a digital platform that allows businesses to buy and sell carbon credits was launched on wednesday march 16 by singapore based carbon exchange and marketplace climate impact x cix called project marketplace the platform will allow firms to discover compare and purchase carbon credits from various projects around the world for a start the marketplace will mainly feature carbon credits from nature based solutions such as forest conservation efforts as forests can take in planet warming carbon dioxide co2 from the air through photosynthesis every unit of co2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit there are currently about 10 to 15 such projects listed on the platform including the tambopata bahuaja biodiversity reserve located in the peruvian amazon the agroforestry project which spans an area roughly the size of los angeles entails the restoration of degraded areas there help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production reducing their need to cut down trees in the area cix chief executive mikkel larsen said credits from nature based solutions typically range from us 12 s 16 35 to us 17 per credit he said he expects those listed on project marketplace will be on the higher end although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier mr larsen also said that other types of carbon projects such as those that use technology to suck up co2 from the atmosphere will be listed on project marketplace in the second half of this year the global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity co2 produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions cix which was jointly established last year by dbs bank singapore exchange standard chartered and temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market once the credits purchased are used to offset a firm's emissions the platform can also be used to retire the credits which means a credit is taken off the market never to be traded or swapped again so as to ensure carbon savings are not double counted the launch of the marketplace comes as the government announced last month that large emitters in singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can from 2024 buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions mr larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market especially during periods of uncertainty responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible lasting climate impact our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits said mr larsen to achieve that goal we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data insights and practical guidance to our wider community for example the project marketplace platform will feature third party ratings supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data of the various carbon projects listed on it cix said it works with sylvera a firm that provides data on nature based offset projects sylvera provides information about each project such as the permanence of the carbon removal co benefits of nature based projects and risk global demand for carbon credits is expected to grow following an outcome at last november's climate change conference cop26 that allows countries to buy carbon credits to meet the climate targets they set for themselves under the paris agreement this has made the set up of carbon projects more profitable for land developers who may choose to conserve a forest to sell carbon credits instead of cutting it down for oil palm or other crops but observers have pointed out that such projects need to be established in consultation with indigenous communities living on the land international media outlets have reported on how a controversial carbon trading deal in malaysian borneo was inked with no due diligence or consultation with the indigenous groups living there asked how cix will ensure that credits sold on its project marketplace platform will respect the rights of affected communities mr larsen said social integrity was a key component of cix's assessment of a project before it is listed on the platform he also pointed to cix's independent international advisory council which provides views on the latest science policy and market application the council comprises various experts from academics to non government organisations observers and representatives from global verification bodies we also want to have representation from indigenous communities he said acknowledging that this was a complex issue that varies among countries he said cix was taking steps to assess the various projects in consultation with its advisory council that is ultimately our safeguard of making sure that there is community engagement and that there are no infringement on local communities he said find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the st

        "content": "sydney australia s great barrier reef has suffered severe coral bleaching according to new data which raises further concerns about the future of the iconic world heritage site the great barrier reef marine park authority gbrmpa the official authority that manages the massive marine park conducted aerial surveys that found widespread bleaching in the far north and central sections of the 2 300 km reef including some areas where bleaching had been severe further surveys are still being conducted including over the main tourism areas where the heat stress is believed to have been less dire and the bleaching may be less severe bleaching has been detected across the marine park it is widespread but variable across multiple regions ranging in impact from minor to severe the authority said in an update on friday march 18 the finding follows a series of mass bleaching events in recent years as climate change has led to warmer sea temperatures and underwater heatwaves that are posing a serious threat to the health of the reef mass bleaching events had not been recorded until 1998 but have since occurred in 2002 2016 2017 and 2020 the bleaching involves coral expelling the algae that live inside it which leaves the coral colourless bleached corals can die though they can also recover and survive if conditions on the affected reef ease an expert on coral bleaching professor terry hughes from james cook university said he believed the latest survey data indicates that a sixth mass bleaching event is occurring ongoing aerial surveys of coral bleaching reveal so far a footprint of mass bleaching similar to 2017 when the central 500km region was hardest hit he said in a tweet on friday how many more maps will it take to trigger real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions the gbrmpa said it would not declare a mass bleaching event until all surveys and data analysis had been examined the authority s survey results come just days before the start of a united nations monitoring mission whose findings will inform a meeting in june that will decide if the reef s world heritage status will be downgraded such a move could threaten the lucrative tourism industry generated by the reef and would also be humiliating for the federal government the ruling liberal national coalition has been heavily criticised for its refusal to adopt stronger cuts to carbon emissions even as the government s own reef authority warned of the threat that climate change poses to the reef the current bleaching is particularly concerning because it is occurring in the midst of a la ni a weather pattern which typically brings cooler temperatures and cloud and rain that help to cool the reef and prevent bleaching during the past week sea surface temperatures in the reef were between 0 5 and 2 deg c above average what is most concerning is that this widespread bleaching is happening during a la nina weather event dr lissa schindler from the australian marine conservation society said in a statement it shows the consistent pressure our reef is now under from global heating a healthy reef can recover from coral bleaching but it needs time the environment minister ms sussan ley said the federal government had recently invested an extra a 1 billion s 1 billion in the reef to strengthen its resilience in the face of these challenges this is the best managed reef in the world and as a result of our collaborations with scientists reef managers traditional owners farmers and local communities it is also the most closely monitored a spokesman told abc news last year unesco recommended that the reef should be placed on the list of world heritage sites that are in danger but the proposal sparked lobbying by the federal government which helped to persuade delegates at the un agency not to downgrade the reef s status scientists and environmental groups have warned for years that the reef is being seriously threatened by ocean warming acidification and extreme weather events such as cyclones mr martin zavan from greenpeace australia pacific said the federal government had thrown billions at band aid measures while failing to address climate change the biggest driver of catastrophic coral damage find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the st microsite here read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "new york nytimes a tree planted for every t shirt purchased for every bottle of wine for every swipe of a credit card trees planted by countries to meet global pledges and by companies to bolster their sustainability records as the climate crisis deepens businesses and consumers are joining non profit groups and governments in a global tree planting boom last year saw billions of trees planted in scores of countries around the world these efforts can be a triple win providing livelihoods absorbing and locking away planet warming carbon dioxide co2 and improving the health of ecosystems but when done poorly the projects can worsen the very problems they were meant to solve planting the wrong trees in the wrong place can actually reduce biodiversity speeding extinctions and making ecosystems far less resilient addressing biodiversity loss already a global crisis akin to climate change is becoming more and more urgent extinction rates are surging an estimated million species are at risk of disappearing many within decades and ecosystem collapse doesn't just threaten animals and plants it imperils the food and water supplies that humans rely on amid that worsening crisis companies and countries are increasingly investing in tree planting that carpets large areas with commercial non native species in the name of fighting climate change these trees sock away carbon but provide little support to the webs of life that once thrived in those areas you're creating basically a sterile landscape said paul smith who runs botanic gardens conservation international an umbrella group that works to prevent plant extinctions if people want to plant trees let's also make it a positive for biodiversity there's a rule of thumb in the tree planting world one should plant the right tree in the right place some add for the right reason but according to interviews with a range of players scientists policy experts forestry companies and tree planting organisations people often disagree on what right means for some it's big tree farms for carbon storage and timber for others it's providing fruit trees to small scale farmers for others still it's allowing native species to regenerate the best efforts try to address a range of needs according to restoration experts but it can be hard to reconcile competing interests it's kind of the wild west said forrest fleischman a professor of environmental policy at the university of minnesota harm in the name of doing good' there is not enough land on earth to tackle climate change with trees alone but if paired with drastic cuts in fossil fuels trees can be an important natural solution they absorb co2 through pores in their leaves and stash it away in their branches and trunks though trees also release carbon when they burn or rot that ability to collect co2 is why forests are often called carbon sinks in central africa totalenergies the french oil and gas giant has announced plans to plant trees on 40 000 hectares in the republic of congo the project on the bat k plateau a rolling mosaic of grasses and wooded savanna with patches of denser forests would sequester more than 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over 20 years according to the company total is committing to the development of natural carbon sinks in africa said nicolas terraz who was then total's senior vice president for africa exploration and production in a company news release on the project in 2021 these activities build on the priority initiatives taken by the group to avoid and reduce emissions in line with its ambition to get to net zero by 2050 to achieve net zero companies must remove at least as much carbon from the air as they release many like totalenergies are turning to trees for help with that on the bat k plateau an acacia species from australia intended for selective logging will cover a large area the project part of a congolese government program to expand forest cover and increase carbon storage would create jobs the company said and ultimately broaden the ecosystem's biodiversity as local species are allowed to grow in over decades but scientists warn that the plan may be an example of one of the worst kinds of forestation efforts planting trees where they would not naturally occur these projects can devastate biodiversity threaten water supplies and even increase temperatures because in some cases trees absorb heat that grasslands or in other parts of the world snow would have reflected we don't want to cause harm in the name of doing good said bethanie walder executive director of the society for ecological restoration a global non profit the bat k plateau is one of the least studied ecosystems in africa according to paula nieto quintano an environmental scientist who has focused on the region its importance for local livelihoods its ecology and ecosystem functions are poorly understood nieto said those who study forest restoration emphasise that trees are not a cure all i fear that many corporations and governments are seeing this as an easy way out said robin chazdon a professor of tropical forest restoration at the university of the sunshine coast in australia they don't necessarily have to work as hard to reduce their emissions because they can just say 'oh we're offsetting that by planting trees' 'there have been bad actors' all trees store carbon but their other benefits vary widely depending on the species and where it's planted eucalyptus for instance grows fast and straight making it a lucrative lumber product native to australia and a few islands to the north its leaves feed koalas which evolved to tolerate a potent poison they contain but in africa and south america where the trees are widely grown for timber fuel and increasingly carbon storage they provide far less value to wildlife they are also blamed for depleting water and worsening wildfires experts acknowledge that forest restoration and carbon sequestration are complex and that commercial species have a role to play people need timber a renewable product with a lower carbon footprint than concrete or steel they need paper and fuel for cooking planting fast growing species for harvest can sometimes help preserve surrounding native forests and by strategically adding native species tree farms can help biodiversity by creating wildlife corridors to link disconnected habitat areas this restoration movement can't happen without the private sector said michael becker head of communications at 1t org a group created by the world economic forum to push for the conservation and growth of 1 trillion trees with help from private investment historically there have been bad actors but we need to bring them into the fold and doing the right thing a challenge is that helping biodiversity doesn't offer the financial return of carbon storage or timber markets many governments have set standards for reforestation efforts but they often provide broad leeway in wales one of the most deforested countries in europe the government is offering incentives for tree planting but growers need only include 25 per cent native species to qualify for government subsidies in kenya and brazil rows of eucalyptus grow on land that was once ecologically rich forest and savanna in peru a company called reforesta per is planting trees on degraded amazonian land but it's increasingly using cloned eucalyptus and teak intended for export investors prefer them because they bring better prices said enrique toledo general manager of reforesta per they are well known species internationally and there is an unsatisfied demand for wood when researchers from university college london and the university of edinburgh evaluated national commitments toward reforestation and restoration they found that 45 per cent involved planting vast monocultures of trees as profitable enterprises 'the same species all over the world' when businesses promise to plant a tree for every purchase of a given product they typically do so via non profit groups that work with communities around the world the support may reforest after wildfires or provide fruit and nut trees to farmers but even these projects can compromise biodiversity the planet is home to nearly 60 000 tree species a third are threatened with extinction mainly from agriculture grazing and exploitation but globally only a tiny fraction of species are widely planted according to tree planting groups and scientists they're planting the same species all over the world said meredith martin an assistant professor of forestry at north carolina state university who found that non profit tree planting efforts in the tropics tend to prioritise the livelihood needs of people over biodiversity or carbon storage over time she said these efforts risk reducing biodiversity in forests non profit tree planting groups often say they plant non native species because local communities ask for them but deeper engagement can yield a different story said susan chomba who oversees forest restoration and conservation in africa for the world resources institute a global research non profit group when given the chance to consider what they want to accomplish on their land farmers will recall for instance that when they had more trees they also had streams she said they want the water back then you say 'in your traditional local knowledge what kind of tree species are suitable for returning water into the ecosystem ' chomba continued they will give you a whole range of indigenous tree species a major hurdle is lack of supply at local seed banks which tend to be dominated by popular commercial species some groups overcome this problem by paying people to collect seeds from nearby forests another solution experts say is to let forests come back on their own if the area is only lightly degraded or sits near existing forest a method called natural regeneration can be cheaper and more effective simply fencing off certain areas from grazing will often allow trees to return with both carbon sequestration and biodiversity built in

deg c greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o help trap the sun's warmth just like the glass of a greenhouse does over millennia the levels of these gases especially co2 have varied and so have temperatures the difference now is that mankind's activities are adding so much co2 ch4 n2o and several other potent greenhouse gases that things are heating up very quickly much faster than in the past co2 levels are now the highest in 3 5 million years and this rise has occurred in little over a century most of it in the past 50 years average temperatures globally are now 1 2 deg c higher than pre industrial times this means humankind is moving into a world we have never experienced the natural world is also struggling with hotter temperatures hotter oceans droughts and extreme weather events threatening the future of many species the simple answer is rapid population growth and an insatiable demand for resources to fuel economic expansion burning fossil fuels coal oil and gas is mainly to blame but deforestation and agriculture too consumption of fossil fuels coal especially has soared in recent decades though developed nations are responsible for the bulk of accumulated emissions a major source of recent emissions growth has come from big developing nations such as china india and indonesia as shown in the graph below china's emissions are now about double those of the united states the world's second top co2 emitter china is the world's top coal producer and consumer relying on coal for nearly 60 per cent of its energy needs in an effort to curb the growth of coal use and meet rising demand for electricity china is also the world's top renewable energy investor but displacing coal remains a huge challenge rapid expansion of coal fired power stations in china has caused emissions to soar china is now by far the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter producing about 28 per cent of mankind's carbon emissions mostly from coal over the past three decades oil and gas consumption has also risen sharply big developing nations are now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions growth while emissions from the us and european union have been declining as they switch to cleaner sources of energy historically though the us has been most responsible for humanity's share of co2 in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age a recent analysis by carbon brief looked at the nations historically responsible for most of the co2 emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere since 1850 included were emissions from fossil fuels and cement production and from land use change and forestry mainly deforestation carbon brief found that the us china and russia account for nearly 40 per cent of accumulated co2 emissions from human activity brazil and indonesia ranked fourth and fifth are responsible for another 8 6 per cent largely because of decades of deforestation germany comes next in the top 10 list followed by india britain japan and canada deforestation and forest fires are big sources of co2 trees naturally soak up large amounts of co2 from the air for photosynthesis storing the carbon in their trunks roots and the soil chopping them down stops this and rotting and burning timber releases lots of co2 burgeoning demand for food especially grains meat and vegetable oils has led to millions of hectares of forest being cleared to create farmland recent research published in the nature food journal found that the global production of food is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gases from human activity the production of meat as well as livestock feed is responsible for 57 per cent of all food production emissions the research found with 29 per cent coming from the cultivation of plant based foods the risks and causes of climate change have long been known with the united nations creating a special climate science body the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in 1988 more than half of all cumulative global co2 emissions from human activity have taken place since 1990 just as international climate science efforts and climate diplomacy were getting off the ground the chart below from the global carbon atlas shows annual growth in co2 emissions which have grown especially strongly since 2000 in 1990 the ipcc issued its first report on the science and risks of climate change the report underlined the importance of climate change as a challenge with global consequences and requiring international cooperation since then the ipcc's reports issued every five to six years have made progressively stronger conclusions about the threat from climate change and that mankind is unequivocally to blame in its most recent report in august 2021 the ipcc concluded that climate change is widespread rapid and intensifying with some impacts such as sea level rise now irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years as temperatures rise the intensity and severity of events such as heatwaves flooding rains and droughts increases the greater the average global warming the worse things become as shown in the chart below under current conditions with global average temperatures rising 1 deg c since pre industrial times today extreme heat events are already happening 2 8 times more often than they did between 1850 and 1900 if temperatures were to rise to 1 5 deg c the chances of extreme heat events would spike to 4 1 times more often yet despite the warnings the years of scientific evidence and the sharp increase in the severity of extreme weather events many governments have been slow to act emissions have kept rising and temperatures along with them think of climate change as a runaway train only deep and swift emissions cuts acting like powerful brakes will slow the train before the bend ahead the ipcc says warming could hit 1 5 deg c within a decade unless carbon emissions are dramatically cut as the chart below shows global average temperatures have been rising quickly since the 1970s in line with rapid global economic growth and rising fossil fuel consumption beyond the 1 5 deg c temperature threshold is a future with far more intense weather extremes that threaten human health and livelihoods every half a degree rise in temperature matters says the ipcc and a 2 deg c rise would lead to higher crop losses and near total destruction of coral reefs as we know them reefs are already under severe pressure the great barrier reef has lost 50 per cent of its shallow water coral cover in just a few decades yet current climate pledges of all nations are putting the world on a path to warm 2 7 deg c by the end of this century a level that will greatly accelerate sea level rise as ice caps in antarctica and greenland melt faster satellite data shows the greenland and antarctic ice sheets are losing ice six times faster than they were in the 1990s twenty six years of climate diplomacy comes to a head at a major un climate meeting in glasgow from oct 31 to nov 12 called cop26 since the first meeting cop1 in berlin in 1995 nations especially rich nations have been under pressure to cut emissions to limit global warming but progress in the un climate diplomacy arena has been slow and failed to limit rapid growth of emissions in the atmosphere or rising temperatures the overall goal for cop26 is for nations to step up emissions cuts to keep the 1 5 deg c warming limit within sight and to finally achieve us 100 billion s 135 billion in annual climate finance for poorer vulnerable nations several major polluting nations including china and india have yet to announce their new or updated climate pledges as mandated under the 2015 paris climate agreement under the paris pact nearly 200 nations agreed to limit warming to well below 2 deg c and aim for 1 5 deg c if possible getting there means net zero emissions by 2050 cop26 is regarded by the un as the last chance to avoid a climate catastrophe

climate pact will provide greater clarity for nations to implement stronger domestic climate policies that will help the world avoid harsher climate impacts the straits times gives an overview of the climate negotiations and the outcomes from cop26 in 2015 almost 200 nations adopted the paris agreement which sets out global aims but not how they can be achieved after three years of negotiations nations agreed in 2018 to adopt the paris rulebook a guide on how the agreement can be implemented at cop24 in poland the rulebook was like an almost complete jigsaw puzzle that was missing a few key pieces the main outline was there but a number of thorny issues needed to be worked out for a global consensus to be reached limit global warming to well below 2 deg c preferably to 1 5 deg c above pre industrial levels this threshold is needed to avoid harsher climate impacts achieve net zero emissions by 2050 take action to adapt to climate change impacts such as building coastal infrastructure to keep out rising seas direct capital towards a low carbon future the cop26 meeting aimed to finalise details of how the paris agreement can be implemented the straits times highlights six key issues that negotiators discussed the six pieces of the jigsaw that will help pave the way for putting the agreement into effect the glasgow meeting was all about limiting warming meaning the world needs to make deeper faster cuts to emissions from burning fossil fuels or deforestation cop26 host britain said a key outcome was to keep 1 5 deg c within reach the only way to achieve this was for nations to beef up their climate pledges called nationally determined contributions ndcs under the paris agreement new climate pledges must be submitted every five years many countries submitted their first round of pledges in 2015 or 2016 this year's conference which was postponed by a year due to the covid 19 pandemic marks the second round of submissions from countries the second round of pledges set out targets to be achieved by the year 2030 countries were expected to collectively pledge much more ambitious emissions reductions but in an analysis of the 2030 targets set out by countries research consortium climate action tracker said the pledges still put the world on a path to warming by 2 4 deg c by the end of the century rapid emissions cuts would require trillions of dollars of investment in renewable energy and slashing reliance on fossil fuels something many countries especially developing nations are unable or reluctant to do the text emphasises the urgent need for all parties to increase efforts to cut emissions highlighting that current pledges are far from what is needed it also asks nations to pursue efforts to limit warming to the 1 5 deg c goal and reiterates that climate impacts would be less severe at this level it requests nations to revisit and strengthen their 2030 targets in their ndcs by the end of 2022 it also calls for a phase down of coal plants that do not capture co2 pollution it notes with serious concern that emissions are on track for a 13 7 per cent increase by 2030 vs the 45 per cent decrease required to limit warming to 1 5 deg c the pact also urges those that have yet to update their ndcs to do so as soon as possible and requests the un climate body to publish annual snapshots of collective ndcs to gauge ambition if the glasgow conference was all about cutting emissions it is money that is going to make this happen poorer nations want wealthier ones to make good on a pledge they made over a decade ago to channel us 100 billion s 135 billion in annual climate finance by 2020 to green their economies and help them adapt to climate impacts developing nations are the least responsible for the decades of planet warming emissions in the atmosphere but they are feeling the impacts most keenly from rising sea levels and more powerful storms that batter their coastlines and wipe out homes and crops to severe droughts and heatwaves climate cash has become an issue of trust that rich nations will do as they say rich nations have dragged their feet on this issue with climate funding hitting only us 79 6 billion in 2019 the us 100 billion pledge still came up short in glasgow it might be reached by next year helped by additional pledges from japan denmark and others during the conference adaptation finance flows will be at least double 2019 levels by 2025 going some way to meet a demand by poorer nations for more adaptation money the final text also calls upon parties to rapidly scale up the deployment of clean power generation and accelerate efforts towards the phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies the issue of finance also extends to the irretrievable loss and damage caused by climate impacts such as loss of life and damage to infrastructure poorer nations are seeking additional finance to cope with the rising and repeated costs of climate change this is a critical issue for the poorest and most vulnerable nations such as small island nations greatly threatened by rising sea levels and storms repeated losses and damage threaten livelihoods and economic development this has been a long running issue as vulnerable nations regard themselves as innocent victims of impacts caused by big polluting nations while a mechanism has been created to help look at the issue developing nations want commitments on new and additional financial resources but there remains knowledge gaps on the scale of loss and damage and the financing and technical assistance needed industrialised nations are also wary of liability risks and compensation claims greater recognition of the need to address loss and damage though no money was committed developing nations have pushed for money from rich nations to pay for loss and damage caused by climate impacts driven by greenhouse emissions but rich countries have resisted fearing large compensation payments the glasgow pact agreed to greater funding support for a technical body called the santiago network which provides technical assistance to help vulnerable nations avert minimise and address loss and damage the final text removed a reference to a financial facility for loss and damage that aimed to channel funds to poorer nations instead parties agreed to establish the glasgow dialogue to discuss funding with the aim of concluding the talks by mid 2024 the outcome of discussions on carbon markets coded under article 6 of the paris agreement was to determine whether countries can trade carbon credits to meet their ndcs it would also establish rules on who emissions savings accrued to if one nation paid to set up a green initiative say a wind farm instead of a coal plant in another country this was the biggest unresolved piece of the paris rulebook and the only one that failed to reach a consensus at cop24 a consensus was also not reached at cop25 carbon markets can enable cost effective emissions reductions in the short term for example it might be cheaper for one country to pay to conserve a forest elsewhere rather than replace its entire fossil fuel based energy grid with one based on renewables carbon credits can also direct public and private capital to green ventures such as clean cookstoves for poor villages or forest conservation projects but an international carbon market that lacks clear rules could increase global emissions if for example both buyers and sellers of carbon credits claim the reductions under their ndcs the problem of double counting where the countries selling the carbon credits count the carbon savings under their own national targets could be tough to overcome the aim was still to achieve a reduction in overall emissions so carbon markets would have to go beyond offsetting but conflict was possible over which carbon credits are to be set aside and not used for any country's ndcs debate was also ongoing over whether credits generated under the kyoto protocol's clean development mechanism which expired in 2020 could be carried over to the paris agreement with opponents saying this could prevent new additional mitigation activities from being developed there will be no double counting of carbon credits this means that the countries selling the carbon credits cannot count the savings under their own national targets or sell the same credit to two different parties parties also agreed to the carrying over of carbon credits generated under the kyoto protocol if these credits had been generated since 2013 countries also agreed that there would be a levy imposed on trades made under article 6 with the funds going to a fund that will help developing countries better prepare for the impacts of climate change this levy is mandatory for trades made under some parts of article 6 but voluntary in others nations agreed at cop24 in 2018 to adopt the enhanced transparency framework by 2024 this framework requires all countries to report among other things their greenhouse gas emissions their progress in achieving their ndcs how they will be impacted by climate change and how they plan to adapt to these impacts the support they have received from others such as financial aid or training and how these were used previously the reporting requirements and the timetable for the submission of national reports were different for developed and developing countries given that developing countries have relatively less developed institutional capacity for transparency reporting their requirements were less onerous than that of developed countries transparency in measurement reporting and verification of emissions will allow observers to monitor progress in limiting global warming some countries have ndc targets that aim to reduce emissions across their entire economy while others focus on emissions reductions from certain sectors such as their energy or forestry sectors it will not be easy to finalise a common reporting format that can accommodate these different types of pledges an enhanced framework will require nations to find common ground over the kinds of technical assistance that will be provided to developing countries to help them meet it some countries had initially argued for the flexibility to delete rows and columns from the reporting table if they could not provide the information but at cop26 all parties agreed that no deletion would be allowed countries must denote fx which represents 'flexibility' in the reporting tables if they are unable to report certain information but they will need to explain their capacity constraints a new training programme for technical experts to help review the biennial transparency reports from 2024 was also agreed currently ndcs have different end dates some countries set five year targets while others set 10 year ones for example singapore's ndc is a 10 year one in its second ndc announced last year singapore said it will aim to have its emissions peak around 2030 countries had agreed at cop24 that post 2030 ndcs should have a common time frame further delays on setting common time frames would mean that countries have less time adjusting their domestic planning and reviewing processes to meet their targets there was also concern that a longer time frame would lock in high emitting infrastructure such as new fossil fuel plants making it more challenging to limit global temperatures in the long term there was likely to be negotiations over the three options on the table whether ndcs should follow a five or 10 year cycle or a 5 5 cycle that would require countries to use a five year time frame with tentative 10 year targets countries generally agreed on a five year cycle which will be submitted five years before they take effect this means that the next round of climate pledges which are due in 2025 will be for the year 2035 pledges made in 2030 will be for 2040 and so on this decision sets out the international norm for subsequent climate pledges but the language of this provision is weak with parties merely encouraged to do this this gives outlier countries such as those who insist on maintaining a 10 year ndc the flexibility to submit their 2040 ndcs in 2025 for instance find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the st microsite here read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the

        "content": "singapore the sun beat down on our sweat stained backs as we toiled away changkul garden hoe in hand digging into the earth to plant our tree saplings the idea of tree planting i previously had in my head involved removing soil from the surface and i took it to be much easier than my current struggles with the sheer weight of the gardening tool it helps to focus on the mechanics of digging how the changkul is held and thrust into the soil how its handle is levered and how the soil is then gently and effortlessly lifted out getting these techniques right makes a world of difference as i learnt the hard way with plans in place to plant one million trees by 2030 to restore singapore s green canopy the heart of the effort will likely have to be community led this is not easy since urbanites often lack a sense of intimacy with their natural environment acknowledging this national university of singapore nus biology lecturer n sivasothi coordinates regular planting sessions with environmental volunteer group nus toddycats at the kranji coastal nature park where participants can get their hands dirty and play a role in reforesting the area the group which has already made 19 visits one of which i joined to the nature park so far will be working there for the long term said mr sivasothi this helps to create a sense of connection with the land and in turn cultivates an appreciation for singapore's natural habitats he added the national parks board nparks started work to restore the coastal beach and back mangal habitats of kranji coastal nature park in august 2020 the back mangal habitat is a step further from the shore where the mangroves reside native species have been selected to restore these habitats and they include critically endangered species as well as species that help to rejuvenate the soil and attract seed dispersers such as birds this can in turn stimulate the growth of other plants from adjacent forests the quality of the soil is affected by its composition and the area's land use history the particular spot where i was digging looked unassuming and dull but turned out to be teeming with life earthworms millipedes and flies this points to the soil being fertile and healthy whereas dry clay like soil means soil enhancements are needed to improve the sapling's odds of survival the tree sapling i planted was the palaquium obovatum a native flowering species which can grow up to 40m in height once the sapling was planted i covered it with soil careful to ensure that its root collar remained visible so the roots could breathe before adding a wooden stake to provide support when it grows then i sprinkled the sapling generously with dead leaves to form a ring around the base this is done to discourage the growth of weeds that can smother the tree and to also help the tree retain moisture around the roots the decomposing leaves also provide nourishment to the growing sapling the volunteer group i joined on feb 12 planted a total of 60 saplings a small step forward to regenerating the area into a lush green forest where creatures such as the white bellied sea eagle can one day nest comfortably to restore a habitat is to give it new life while at the same time acknowledging loss mr sivasothi has fond memories of the kranji coastal nature park where he conducted coastal cleanups for 20 years as an undergrad i worked with professor dennis murphy a veteran zoologist at various mangrove sites mapping and measuring trees the park at the time was state land and there was a lot of trash as all the kampungs had moved out and trash from the johor straits accumulated in the mangrove he said the wonders of the mangrove ecosystem left an imprint on him so did the trash so when ms kate thome who was then the coordinator of international coastal cleanup singapore approached him to conduct cleanups at the mangroves along the kranji coastline he agreed lots of exceptional volunteers from nus and the public joined the effort and it was a healing experience said mr sivasothi in 2014 when nparks took over the park as part of an extension of the sungei buloh wetland reserve the mangroves were healthy and recruiting new saplings but the land area next to it was a wasteland so in 2020 when nparks initiated their coastal reforestation project there i asked for nus toddycats to be part of it he added i saw many green places disappear over the years but here a reserve was declared expanded and eventually extended to include the mandai mangrove and mudflat nature park in 2018 this was healing for my heart said mr sivasothi i ended the day by virtually planting my tree on the map at nparks' trees sg website and made a promise to myself to return soon to monitor my sapling's health and to plant more trees with more than 600 000 trees to be planted by 2030 i hope that more people step forward and help restore these natural habitats of our island home those who

        "content": "beijing nytimes china did not move mountains to host the 2022 winter olympics but it flooded a dried riverbed diverted water from a key reservoir that supplies beijing and resettled hundreds of farmers and their families all to feed one of the most extensive snow making operations in the history of the games this is what happens when the international olympic committee decides to bring the winter games to a place almost completely lacking in one of the main ingredients for winter sports snow in addition beijing and its nearby mountains did not have that much water to make the artificial kind either machine made snow has played a major role in winter sports for decades even in snowier places like norway switzerland and colorado in beijing's version of the winter games the competitions that began this weekend will for the first time take place almost entirely on artificial snow necessitating an olympic snow making and water management operation of enormous scale and foreshadowing the reality of snow sports everywhere as the planet warms on the mountains where the alpine competitions take place which do not have any recreational skiing narrow strips of white visible from miles away now cut through the brown mountains beijing officials insist that snow production for the games will not strain local water supplies which have struggled to keep pace with the city's demands but china's herculean investments in snow making are part of larger efforts to turn the arid mountains near beijing into a permanent ski and snowboard hub a project that could face challenges as climate change upends patterns of rainfall and drought worldwide the environmentally unfriendly secret of skiing and snowboarding competitions is that as natural snow becomes less reliable they almost always take place on the artificial kind as the planet continues to heat up machine made snow will play an ever larger role in guaranteeing a consistent high calibre field of play you could not have winter sports now without man made snow said mr michael mayr the asia manager of technoalpin the italian company in charge of snow making for the beijing games and at six previous winter olympics what sets beijing apart from many of those past venues are its tight supplies of water whether for snow making or for anything else over the past few decades rapid development has sapped beijing's groundwater july and august often bring heavy rains but the city and nearby mountains get only sprinkles of precipitation in the winter less than 6 35cm per season on average in recent decades according to data from a weather station near the olympic venues in 2017 the last year for which international figures are available beijing had only about as much freshwater resources per resident 164 000 litres as the western african nation of niger at the edge of the sahara zhangjiakou the city 160km north west of the capital that will host some skiing and snowboarding events had 377 000 litres per resident comparable to djibouti in the horn of africa the united states by contrast had 10 5 million litres per person countries with roughly less than one million litres of freshwater resources per person are considered water scarce mr florian hajzeri who has been in china for four years overseeing the snow making project for technoalpin said he realised the magnitude of his task as soon as he saw the landscape of the olympic competition areas there are trees and vegetation but it is not like an alpine forest it is vegetation for a drier climate he said it snows but it is not enough for the competitions before technoalpin could install pumps and build more than 64km of pipe at a cost of nearly us 60 million s 81 million chinese officials first had to figure out how to deliver enough water to the mountains how much water roughly one million cubic m according to technoalpin enough to fill 400 olympic size swimming pools and that is just to start the games more snow and more water will likely be needed as the competitions take place to gather it all the chinese authorities have built pumping stations to carry water from reservoirs miles away according to a state run newspaper beijing has diverted water from the city's baihebao reservoir to the guishui river which flows near the olympic zone but had long been mostly dried up in winter previously baihebao had primarily supplied the miyun reservoir one of the largest stores of clean water for beijing households officials in zhangjiakou have turned off irrigation across thousands of ha to conserve groundwater and resettled farmers who were living in what is now the olympic competition area in high rise apartments modern china is no stranger to monumental water projects its biggest effort to ease beijing's water troubles began well before the olympics a colossal series of waterways that is transferring trillions of litres of water a year from the nation's humid south to its thirsty north hundreds of thousands of villagers were relocated to make way for the canals water from the project accounted for a sixth of beijing's water supply in 2020 while the chinese government has made progress on water issues in recent years scientists and environmentalists say the capital cannot afford to rest on its laurels they still have to do more on water conservation increasing water use efficiency and ensuring social equity in water allocation said professor of water resources engineering ximing cai at the university of illinois urbana champaign if the olympics spur a burst of economic development in the hills near beijing he said the water use associated with that should be planned with caution but climate change could both deepen northern china's need for water and affect southern china's ability to provide it scientists have found that recent severe heat waves and floods in china were much more likely to occur because of human caused climate change under the backdrop

        "content": "singapore when it comes to the impact of climate change nations are on guard for the major ones rising sea levels droughts or floods extreme weather events but a warming world may have more insidious repercussions with a new study led by researchers at the nanyang technological university ntu showing that climate change could also affect the very air we breathe each gulp of air humans take contains more than just life giving oxygen it is also populated with micro organisms such as bacteria and fungi each too small to be seen with the naked eye by studying air samples taken at different heights from ground level and up to 3 500m researchers at ntu's singapore centre for environmental life sciences engineering have shown that as the world warms the composition of micro organisms in the air could change their paper was published on tuesday feb 8 in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america there are already indicators showing that airborne micro organisms can impact human health and agriculture said ntu's professor stephan schuster who supervised the latest work so a changing composition of the air microbiome micro organisms in the air could have implications for human societies he added for example prof schuster's team had found earlier that while healthy people did not suffer ill effects from breathing in micro organisms from the air people with respiratory diseases showed an increased immune response worsening their respiratory symptoms any change in the dynamics of airborne microbial communities could impact respiratory health in an as yet unknown and therefore potentially concerning way prof schuster told the straits times as global temperatures warm heat tolerant micro organisms that thrive in tropical climates could spread to higher latitudes affecting biodiversity and agriculture there this could change disease dynamics for various crop species and potentially also livestock which are not adapted to tropical airborne microbial communities prof schuster added atmospheric micro organisms such as fungi and bacteria usually remain suspended in the air once they are blown off the planet's surface only a fraction of these find their way back down to the surface together with larger particles such as sand grains or dust or when washed down by rain droplets for the latest research which involved more than 30 scientists from ntu as well as their collaborators from institutions in germany and brazil the team took 480 air samples in germany the samples were collected by researchers scaling a 200m meteorological tower and using a research aircraft that circled at different heights from ground level up to 3 500m from the samples the researchers could identify about 10 000 airborne microbial organisms and map out where in the air column they were found they found that the part of the air column from the ground up to about 1 000m where the boundary layer is is rather evenly mixed during the day the boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere closest to the ground and is the part of the air column that is most intimately affected by the ground through interactions with solid earth or water surfaces for instance when the sun beats down on earth the ground warms up faster than the air but the ground re radiates heat causing the air parcel closest to it and the micro organisms it contains to warm and rise up the air column this continues throughout the daylight hours with air parcels closest to the ground constantly being moved up within the boundary layer in turbulent fashion at night however without the heating effect of the sun the air in the boundary layer becomes more stratified or layered with the warmer less dense air parcel sitting atop cooler air parcels closer to the ground said prof schuster this means that airborne microbial organisms remain suspended in the air during night time as their return to the ground is impeded by the denser air masses this effect is also the reason hazy mornings tend to clear up after the sun rises fully when the ground starts to heat up causing air closest to it and the suspended particles they contain to rise the research team found there is a varying air microbiome composition within the boundary layer over the course of a day daytime hours were characterised by larger amounts of bacteria and certain types of fungi while wood rotting fungi thrive at night above the boundary layer however the composition of micro organisms did not change regardless of day or night these stable upper air layers are not affected by daytime circulation patterns in the boundary layer as the day and night temperatures above the boundary layer are the same the researchers think the lack of temperature changes over the course of a day prevents bacteria in the higher layers from returning to the ground at the stable upper levels above the boundary layer the researchers also found the presence of bacteria that can tolerate higher amounts of solar radiation this means these organisms can survive the sun's shortwave radiation unlike more sensitive micro organisms living on the ground these findings say the researchers indicate that temperature would be a key factor in changing the composition of the air microbiome the reason for this lies in the changing height of the boundary layer in a warmer world higher surface temperatures can raise the height of this layer as air near the surface heats up it ascends through the atmosphere pushing the upper boundary higher said prof schuster a higher boundary layer would mean that the part of the air column affected by day night circulation patterns overlaps with the previously stable parts of the atmosphere where a greater abundance of bacteria thrive this could mean that all airborne bacteria and fungi including those that can act as plant pathogens or cause respiratory illnesses in humans and animals could reach densely populated areas of human societies that are currently unaffected how exactly the changing composition of micro organisms in the air could affect human health and ecosystems warrants further research prof schuster said he added that the team hopes to conduct similar studies in other global settings in indoor and outdoor environments to investigate the composition of the air microbiome elsewhere look up there are microbes in the sky he said in reference to the popular netflix satirical film don t look up the movie had through the prism of global reaction towards a fictional comet hurtling towards earth highlighted political and media indifference to climate change changes to the planet's airborne micro organisms driven by climate change could impact

an international team of scientists peel back the layers of how environmental changes can affect wildlife a new study has found that the population growth of three oceanic skater species in the eastern pacific ocean coincided with changes in the climate there the research paper by researchers from the national university of singapore nus and university of california san diego's scripps institution of oceanography was published today sept 6 in scientific journal marine biology their findings show that oceanic skaters can function as a canary in the coal mine in a warming ocean with population trends serving as indicators of how open oceans a challenging habitat to monitor with sensors due to their inaccessibility are changing the study could also help scientists better understand how climate change can impact insects and marine organisms nus marine biologist huang danwei one of the authors of the study said bugs could include parasitic and even disease carrying insects so we might understand whether their populations would overlap substantially with human dominated areas to become a problem for our health oceanic skaters are not easy insects to study their preference for the open ocean means specimens can be obtained only through expensive oceanic expeditions that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a day in 2006 dr lanna cheng sea skater scientist from scripps oceanography learnt that her contacts at the united states' national oceanic and atmospheric administration were planning to go on an oceanic expedition to monitor sea bird whale and dolphin activity in the eastern pacific ocean from california to south america one of the chief scientists on board was interested in flying fish so i said if you are collecting flying fish and shining a light on the surface of the water you must be able to attract my insects too said dr cheng who has been studying these creatures for over five decades and he said 'oh yeah sure no problem' that expedition yielded almost 400 oceanic skater specimens from three species dr cheng who did her bachelor's degree at nus maintained close contacts with scientists at her alma mater in 2017 she sent the skater samples to a laboratory in nus where dr wendy wang was working at that time dr wang was working on a project to see if species could be differentiated just by a fragment of their genome similar to how barcodes can indicate the type of product on sale dr wang found that the barcoding worked but also noticed there were population wide differences in the barcodes of the three different species these genetic variations among the species illustrate different stories of population growth and development during ancient times dr cheng then roped in professor richard norris her colleague at scripps oceanography who specialises in paleoceanography and other nus genomic experts including dr huang and his doctoral student marc chang by matching the genetic data with the fossil record the researchers found that the oldest of the three species halobates splendens went through a population expansion nearly a million years ago this species is now found in the peru current the rich productive waters originating off the coast of south america climatological data showed that this physical feature of cold surface water came into existence a million years ago the two younger species halobates micans and halobates sobrinus now found in the warm relatively unproductive waters off central america increased in abundance 100 000 to 120 000 years ago the populations of both species expanded when el nino climate events caused warm ocean water to move into the eastern pacific ocean el nino events were especially strong in this region about 100 000 years ago which coincides with the time these species developed their modern genetic patterns and population sizes said prof norris the genetics show that the three species we studied each had periods of population growth that fit eerily well with geological evidence for when the current systems they live in came into existence the researchers now plan to study more closely the genetic make up of the oceanic skaters which are hardy creatures exposed to intense sunshine and gusty winds the abilities of their body covering or cuticle to protect their internal organs from heat and ultraviolet damage and to survive violent storms and find food in this unique habitat where no other insect could demonstrate their unique ecological roles in the ocean said dr wang these characteristics make them fascinating subjects of

        "content": "singapore corals can provide a good gauge of singapore's sea level history over the past century with the rising levels recorded over the 20th and 21st century very likely a result of climate change while this can be attributed to multiple factors such as sinking land findings from a nanyang technological university ntu study show that climate change contributed to rising sea levels in the country data from the meteorological service singapore in 2020 had shown that sea levels in singapore had gone up by 14cm since pre 1970 levels dr jedrzej majewski from the earth observatory of singapore eos at ntu who is the lead author of the study said that as the rate of sea level rise over the last 100 years was lower compared with the global average taking away anthropogenic factors would mean that sea level in the country could have been stable or even slightly falling likely due to singapore's geological history anthropogenic factors refer to human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels and cutting down of forests in addition taking into account the recent report by the united nations' intergovernmental panel for climate change ipcc some 70 per cent of the combined change in glaciers ice sheet surface mass balance and thermal expansion since 1970 can be attributed to human activity with this percentage increasing over the course of the 20th and 21st century he noted the latest report from ipcc has found that singapore will face a sea level rise of about 0 2m by 2050 and 1m by 2100 relative to a baseline from the period of 1995 to 2014 this discovery was made possible only through the use of coral microatolls circular colonies of coral which usually grow sideways from mapur an indonesian island about 100km south east of singapore dr majewski added that the corals there can provide a good gauge of singapore's sea level history over the past century the top surface of the coral microatoll is usually made of dead tissue due to exposure to air while living tissue is found growing along its perimeter forming growth rings similar to the ones found on tree trunks these rings therefore make these coral microatolls natural recorders of sea level change and scientists can trace these changes by counting backwards from the outer age where the living tissue is to determine the age of any part of the coral assistant professor aron meltzner from eos who co led the study noted that tide gauge records from tanjong pagar on singapore's sea levels went back only to 1989 whereas the first data point recorded on the coral microatoll dated back to 1915 between 1915 and 1990 sea level rise in singapore was slower than the global average and sea level was essentially stable however before this study we could only extrapolate the probable sea level in singapore from a global average and the more recent tide gauge records this left quite a bit of uncertainty about how high sea level was and how it changed over the period said prof meltzner dr majewski said the microatolls allowed researchers to narrow down the uncertainty of probable sea levels in singapore by over 40 per cent for earlier periods and about 30 per cent for the more recent period of time likening sea level data to investing in the stock market if one looks only at the past two weeks of historical data and notes that a share had fallen by 10 per cent or 15 per cent one might think that investment would be a terrible idea he added however if you extend the data to maybe a month perhaps you would then see that the stock price had risen and then fallen down and if you extend the time period to 50 years you'll see that the recent period is a tiny tiny little blip in over 30 years of growth said dr majewski the same can be extrapolated to sea levels with current data that stretches only to the 1990s the team is able to see only a small part of the big picture while longer term data provides a fuller picture he added this background will be incorporated into future models allowing experts to be more precise with their predictions of future sea levels and for those in singapore to have a better understanding of how the regional sea level change may differ from the global average he said dr majewski pointed out that the youngest coral microatoll records were cross referenced with tide gauges in tanjong pagar from 1989 thereby validating their potential use in reconstructing sea level change in south east asia as he noted the lack of data for the region as a whole in the latest ipcc report there are a lot of places which didn't have any tide gauges installed until maybe the 1980s or the 1990s or still don't have any tide gauges presently so if they had any corals growing and if we found the right ones we can actually reconstruct the sea level change over the past 100 or 200 years said dr majewski prof meltzner said the team is currently studying the microatolls in the southern islands with plans to conduct similar studies in other sites in indonesia and malaysia these can give more robust data on how sea level rise may have a varied impact on different parts of singapore given how different areas may have had

        "content": "singapore imagine a future where food waste is converted into nutrients for food production all in a work of magic by the ubiquitous black soldier fly this is exactly the vision that an interdisciplinary team of researchers hopes to realise as they develop a blueprint to integrate food waste management and sustainable food production in urban settings like singapore assistant professor nalini puniamoorthy from the national university of singapore's department of biological sciences who is leading the project told the straits times that singapore faces a two fold challenge in its journey to food security as the issue is not only with reducing food waste but also with increasing food production in a sustainable way nearly 700 000 tonnes of food waste is incinerated on a yearly basis while efforts to grow singapore's own local produce are very heavily dependent on imported agricultural inputs such as mineral fertiliser and animal feed that increase the cost of local food production and could have an adverse impact on the environment prof nalini said so we're trying to marry these problems and we think it is feasible by trying to take advantage of what nature already does and that is to use these flies that are nature's very own recyclers she said as larvae black soldier flies are able to consume up to four times their body weight in food waste daily converting the waste into a by product known as frass which can be used to substitute or supplement commercial fertilisers in agriculture the larvae being rich in protein and fats can be used in animal feed formulations for poultry and aquaculture diets the project which prof nalini led with professor stephen cairns from the singapore eth centre's future cities lab global programme is done in collaboration with researchers from the nanyang technological university ntu and eth zurich the three year project is funded by the national research foundation under its campus for research excellence and technological enterprise programme prof cairns said designing fully circular food systems for high density cities like singapore requires experimentation at different scales larger centralised black soldier fly larvae processing facilities could be integrated with food production areas to reduce waste at source and further downstream at hotels and wholesale retailers while compact decentralised facilities could be linked to restaurants hawker centres and urban farms even smaller mobile units might cover more ground in residential areas community farms and construction and harbour sites he added singapore is the first country in asia that is studying the possibility of rolling out black soldier fly facilities on a national scale though such integrated food ecosystems are more established in european suburban and agricultural towns said prof nalini she added that the large scale endeavour will also bring singapore closer to its 30 by 30 goal of increasing the capability and capacity of growing 30 per cent of its food needs locally by 2030 the project which began this month will span five interrelated themes each covered by experts in insect rearing urban design sustainability as well as food safety and nutrition these themes are one of the challenges faced by black soldier flies in an urban environment like singapore would be their reproduction as they need a large space to mate and special conditions to allow for high fertility rates said prof nalini who has a background in evolutionary genomics so what we've been doing is optimising and selecting certain reproductive traits that enable them to mate in small spaces she added the other area of research would be to test the black soldier flies on diverse sources of food waste using machine learning professor alexander mathys from eth zurich's sustainable food processing group told the straits times that this involves using real time sensors to monitor larval behaviour and environmental conditions along with different food waste inputs to determine the most efficient combination said prof cairns recently the idea of producing food in the city is becoming very important as it is a key plank of sustainable future city planning architects often use this term biophilic design which means that we must learn from nature but in my experience architects and designers often only look at the forms and they do so in a way where there's no actual tension between nature and the city in designing an integrated food system however there is a need to consider the more unpleasant aspects of biophilic design such as the smell of food rotting for example how do people interact with the possibility of closing the loop with these facilities which of course is smelly dirty and perhaps has a kind of stigma attached to it said prof cairns this would have a part to play in determining where these black soldier fly facilities are located such as considering whether they are to be situated at the edge of the island near an agricultural zone or completely decentralised and located close to every hawker centre it could also be a combination of all of the above prof cairns added to understand the benefits and costs of introducing black soldier flies to singapore's food management system assistant professor janice lee from the ntu's asian school of the environment will be studying factors such as carbon emissions and energy consumption of using frass or larvae from black soldier flies as an agricultural or aquacultural input for instance this will involve studying whether having a more localised production for these inputs will be able to reduce carbon emission as opposed to importing them to do so data will have to be collected from those conducting agricultural and aquacultural activities and from those who run black soldier fly facilities one big question which many singaporeans will have is whether the quality of local food or produce will change to that end the study will look at whether fish meal used for aquaculture farming such as tilapia and barramundi can be replaced with black soldier fly larvae as the continuous use of fish meal is unsustainable for the environment said assistant professor joyce ong from ntu's asian school of the environment experiments will also be under way to look at the growth rate of the fish as well as their biochemical aspects such as the taste of its flesh she added frass which is left behind from black soldier flies will also be tested as a fertiliser for growing plants such as leafy greens in partnership with plant biologists and urban farms said prof nalini we'll also be monitoring the soil microbial biodiversity and see if there are any benefits because black soldier flies' chitin a fibrous material which functions as a scaffolding material for insects has some anti microbial properties too she noted local food waste streams will also be monitored for their nutritional profile and to look out for any metal contaminants or pathogenic micro organisms to ensure food safety the final but most important part of the project would be to translate the research to both the industry and the community said prof nalini the first such community black soldier fly facility was set up in tampines over a year ago in partnership with environmental consultancy firm otolith enrichment and singapore food agency the team is also working with a few other industrial partners to deal with different types of industrial food waste prof nalini added what i envision in my rose coloured glasses is that even when kids go to school they will know how to separate their food waste after eating in the canteen which will be given to the school garden for growing vegetables and when they go back home they see food waste they're able to tell their parents that they're wasting food education goes hand in hand with application and i think we can effect the change if we're able to show that this entire system will work she added join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now

        "content": " london reuters afp hsbc europe s leading banker to corporate asia laid out its long awaited policy on financing thermal coal on tuesday dec 14 and said it expected all its clients to have a plan in place to exit the fossil fuel by the end of 2023 coal is contentious for governments across asia as they look to move away from the cheap and widely used but carbon intensive energy source to help meet a global commitment to cut emissions in the fight against climate change under its plan hsbc will cut exposure to thermal coal financing by at least 25 per cent by 2025 and 50 per cent by 2030 although non eu or non oecd based clients could be funded until a global phase out by 2040 its sustainability chief told reuters however groups which had campaigned for hsbc to issue an explicit policy on thermal coal said the bank s plan did not go far enough and still lacked sufficient urgency building on an existing pledge not to finance new coal fired power plants or thermal coal mines hsbc said its policy would help phase out existing coal use in line with the science of climate change and be reviewed annually we need to tackle some of the hard issues head on coal is one of the big issues it contributes 25 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions hsbc group chief sustainability officer celine herweijer said it s not good enough to have a policy on no new coal we need to turn our attention to the urgent phase out of coal alongside the scientific timelines as one of europe s largest banks and with exposure to the industry in emerging markets in asia and elsewhere hsbc has faced pressure from investors and activists to cut funding to those using coal the dirtiest of fossil fuels jeanne martin senior campaign manager at shareaction a group that aims to improve corporate action on environmental social and governance issues said the fact hsbc had introduced a coal phase out policy was in itself a victory for shareholder engagement with banks on climate but more was needed whilst an important step forward the policy lacks the urgency and rigour required to avert the climate crisis she said campaign group reclaim finance which lobbies for a greener financial sector said the plan by hsbc does not put a hard stop to its financing of the coal sector it said the bank provided us 4 1 billion s 5 6 billion to companies planning new coal plants and us 15 billion to the entire coal industry including in energy hungry asia financial institutions who are serious in their net zero commitments should instead blacklist all coal developers without exception it added at the most recent round of global climate talks in scotland last month governments for the first time acknowledged that fossil fuels were the main driver of global warming although coal dependent countries including india and china would only agree to phase down coal fired power while hsbc in common with peers had previously set out a high level commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions across its customer base by 2050 activists had criticised the strength and detail of its policies that prompted some investors to back a planned shareholder vote on the issue at the company s annual meeting this year although they withdrew the threat after the company pledged to release details on coal by the end of this year in a victory for campaigners hsbc said its new policy would apply to all parts of its business including its us 621 billion asset management arm and cover all aspects of financing including refinancing and advisory services the bank said it would next year announce a science based target for coal fired power in line with capping global warming at 1 5 degrees celsius above pre industrial averages with progress on cutting thermal coal financing to be published annually the bank said it would withdraw services from any client that seeks to expand thermal coal production after jan 1 2021 and would no longer finance clients in eu oecd markets for which thermal coal makes up more than 40 per cent of revenues or 30 per cent from 2025 unless the money is explicitly used for clean technology or infrastructure while peers including standard chartered and natwest have set tougher targets hsbc is more exposed to energy clients with a heavy reliance on coal and says it needs to work with them to help them shift to greener energy what will make or break the world s ability to get to this 1 5 degree target is for the energy transition in asia to happen at the speed and scale it needs to happen and we need to be at the heart of influencing that for clients outside the eu and oecd hsbc said it would evaluate their transition plans before deciding whether to offer finance acknowledging the infrastructure policy and resource obstacles many face compared to developed market peers hsbc said it expects clients to publish their own transition plans although campaigners including shareaction have previously said such language would leave hsbc too much wiggle room the spirit of the policy would also cover intermediaries and the parent group of any client that falls outside the policy and hsbc would ask for a commitment that no finance flowed to that entity herweijer said we are not expecting every client to have a credible transition plan in those cases we will have to move away from those relationships herweijer said

        "content": "singapore a digital platform that allows businesses to buy and sell carbon credits was launched on wednesday march 16 by singapore based carbon exchange and marketplace climate impact x cix called project marketplace the platform will allow firms to discover compare and purchase carbon credits from various projects around the world for a start the marketplace will mainly feature carbon credits from nature based solutions such as forest conservation efforts as forests can take in planet warming carbon dioxide co2 from the air through photosynthesis every unit of co2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit there are currently about 10 to 15 such projects listed on the platform including the tambopata bahuaja biodiversity reserve located in the peruvian amazon the agroforestry project which spans an area roughly the size of los angeles entails the restoration of degraded areas there help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production reducing their need to cut down trees in the area cix chief executive mikkel larsen said credits from nature based solutions typically range from us 12 s 16 35 to us 17 per credit he said he expects those listed on project marketplace will be on the higher end although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier mr larsen also said that other types of carbon projects such as those that use technology to suck up co2 from the atmosphere will be listed on project marketplace in the second half of this year the global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity co2 produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions cix which was jointly established last year by dbs bank singapore exchange standard chartered and temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market once the credits purchased are used to offset a firm's emissions the platform can also be used to retire the credits which means a credit is taken off the market never to be traded or swapped again so as to ensure carbon savings are not double counted the launch of the marketplace comes as the government announced last month that large emitters in singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can from 2024 buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions mr larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market especially during periods of uncertainty responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible lasting climate impact our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits said mr larsen to achieve that goal we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data insights and practical guidance to our wider community for example the project marketplace platform will feature third party ratings supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data of the various carbon projects listed on it cix said it works with sylvera a firm that provides data on nature based offset projects sylvera provides information about each project such as the permanence of the carbon removal co benefits of nature based projects and risk global demand for carbon credits is expected to grow following an outcome at last november's climate change conference cop26 that allows countries to buy carbon credits to meet the climate targets they set for themselves under the paris agreement this has made the set up of carbon projects more profitable for land developers who may choose to conserve a forest to sell carbon credits instead of cutting it down for oil palm or other crops but observers have pointed out that such projects need to be established in consultation with indigenous communities living on the land international media outlets have reported on how a controversial carbon trading deal in malaysian borneo was inked with no due diligence or consultation with the indigenous groups living there asked how cix will ensure that credits sold on its project marketplace platform will respect the rights of affected communities mr larsen said social integrity was a key component of cix's assessment of a project before it is listed on the platform he also pointed to cix's independent international advisory council which provides views on the latest science policy and market application the council comprises various experts from academics to non government organisations observers and representatives from global verification bodies we also want to have representation from indigenous communities he said acknowledging that this was a complex issue that varies among countries he said cix was taking steps to assess the various projects in consultation with its advisory council that is ultimately our

because our residents are elderly and vulnerable there is also disappointment that despite the many measures we put in covid 19 still crept into our nursing home she said but the news also injected urgency to ring fence cases and avoid a cluster on the premises over the next few weeks ms teo 39 and her team at ntuc health jurong west nursing home tested all the residents they tended to anxious seniors in divided zones while keeping concerned relatives updated after visits were suspended the home has about 180 staff and 250 residents at present the employees also tried their best to boost residents' spirits with simple gestures we gave out sugar free mooncakes set up a vanity corner so residents could dress up or put on some nail polish and volunteers brought radios for the residents to listen to music moving freely within their zones helped the residents feel occupied said ms teo on sept 5 four days after 92 year old mr kwai was detected as the first covid 19 case another resident mr tan 86 who was from the same ward tested positive both have been identified by their last names to protect their identities mr tan was isolated and swab tests were stepped up at the nursing home with daily antigen rapid tests arts conducted for the residents behind the scenes the staff relied on one another and their families for support ms teo said most of the staff had to put in extra hours and some of the staff took on 12 hour shifts as nurses we are very mindful of practising safe distancing and monitoring our own health it's a challenging situation for everyone particularly foreign nurses who have not seen their loved ones for a long time a mother of four boys aged five to 13 ms teo said her husband helped to supervise home based learning for the children while she was working she added that there were times when she had to work through the weekend and her family members were mindful that they did not go out into the community too often and risk being infected after nearly a month of heightened precautions the nursing home reported no new cases mr tan was discharged from hospital on sept 22 and welcomed back at the facility we had a celebration with our residents at the end of our surveillance period and when mr tan returned to the nursing home mr tan's son called us and said even though he could not visit his father he was thankful for our constant updates and glad his father was in our care that was a heart warming moment for us ms teo said mr kwai was discharged from hospital on oct 8 staff and residents are relieved they were able to prevent a covid 19 cluster three or more linked cases are considered a cluster in singapore but the daily number of cases in the community is a grim reminder that the risk of further transmission persists in nursing homes on oct 12 the ministry of health moh reported 99 total cases at united medicare centre in toa payoh 85 residents 13 staff and a household member of a case cases were reported at a number of nursing homes last month including man fatt lam elderly joy day centre in bedok windsor convalescent home in pasir panjang and and woodlands care home in woodlands to detect cases early and prevent clusters the nursing homes began testing all residents for covid 19 from sept 27 nursing homes have also adopted several measures including dividing premises into distinct zones for staff and residents to safeguard senior residents dr goh siew hor head of clinical services at ntuc health said the five nursing homes it runs continue to engage residents and their relatives and encourage seniors to be fully vaccinated and opt for a booster shot later going forward he noted that it is prudent for nursing homes to continue practising infection control measures even as singapore heads towards a covid 19 endemic road map he said while we try our best to prevent our cases from coming into the nursing homes we know that it could happen we hope that the preparations that we have made will help us to identify cases early contain them and minimise the impact on the residents while residents diagnosed with the infection are mostly taken to hospitals the agency for integrated care aic said suitable residents may be admitted to moh's community treatment facilities the community facilities provide more comprehensive medical coverage than nursing homes and can manage seniors who are stable or have mild symptoms the government has been working closely with nursing homes to facilitate vaccination inoculations are carried out by either the home's nursing team or mobile vaccination teams aic urged all unvaccinated residents to take the jab as soon as possible as they are among the most vulnerable and the vaccine can increase their protection against severe illness on oct 5 moh

discuss the dissolution of parliament with the party s other top leaders datuk seri ismail who had previously appeared resistant to calls for snap polls on saturday looked to have aligned his views with that of his party chief ahmad zahid hamidi who has been agitating for snap polls if we are confident of victory we will not wait even a second to dissolve parliament to hold the next elections mr ismail said to a roar of applause from the party s over 5 500 delegates towards the end of the four day assembly mr ismail referred to the top five of the party's leadership to discuss parliament's dissolution comprising zahid deputy president mohamad hasan and three vice presidents mr ismail is the most senior vice president and third in the party hierarchy mr ismail also called for the party to close its ranks echoing calls from zahid and other party leaders who are calling for a general election to be held before an overdue party elections are held in his closing address zahid candidly appeared to indicate that mr ismail might not necessarily lose his premiership should parliament be dissolved he ruled out both himself and najib as they face a slew of court cases as contenders for the top job however he asked his deputy datuk seri mohamad to maybe wait until the 16th general election the next general election will be the 15th one by hierarchy mr mohamad as the no 2 in the party should become the prime minister candidate should zahid rule himself out of the top job later at a news conference zahid was asked if mr ismail has been identified as the party's prime minister candidate for the upcoming national vote zahid's reply we have so many candidates here referring to party leaders in the room including mr ismail and mr mohamad but as you know in johor our poster boy was hasni but we all know the result as you know pm is ismail sabri but i don t think the poster boy is the material to promote right now zahid added zahid was referring to datuk hasni mohammad who was named the candidate for johor menteri besar or the poster boy in local electoral parlance should umno win last saturday's johor state polls but the johor ruler picked another candidate as the johor menteri besar the remarks by mr ismail in his winding up speech at the assembly came just before the delegates passed resolutions to push for snap polls in the second half of this year and to also postpone the party elections until snap polls are concluded the delegates represent grassroots leaders from the party's 191 divisions throughout the country umno deputy president mohamad announced the passing of the resolutions without any objections from the delegates effectively indicating that the party would push for elections to be held after july this year when a confidence and supply agreement between mr ismail and opposition alliance pakatan harapan ph expires zahid an ally of former premier najib razak has been leading a camp in umno pushing for snap polls as they believe an election this year would see umno led barisan nasional win an outright majority to form the next federal government the opposition parties are divided between ph and perikatan nasional alliance leading to their heavy defeats in the melaka and johor state polls both zahid and najib are facing multiple graft charges and najib had already been convicted in one of his court cases related to the 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb scandal mr ismail and several umno leaders who are in his administration were resisting the idea as they attempted to preserve their seven month old administration and had wanted to delay general elections until after party elections are held mr ismail is the first premier who is not chief of his own party and going by hierarchical convention he would not be the coalition s prime minister candidate should bn win a fresh mandate at the next elections an internal umno election would have allowed mr ismail a chance to contest the top job against zahid umno s party elections have been due since 2021 but the amendment to its constitution passed by the assembly on saturday means party polls will now likely be pushed to take place six months after snap polls are conducted thus pushing it effectively to next year mr ismail who appeared sidelined throughout the four day assembly as party leaders aligned to zahid amped the pressure to call for snap polls was surprisingly given the stage to address delegates before the assembly concluded he used the opportunity to announce a slew of government policies including a new minimum wage of rm 1 500 s 486 starting may 1 before reiterating his loyalty and commitment to the party mr ismail currently leads a mixed coalition government consisting of both bn and their electoral rivals pn the government only has a four seat majority mr ismail ascended to the top job only in august last year after zahid ruled himself out to focus on his court cases while mr mohamad was not eligible as he was not a member

        "content": "london bloomberg russia's invasion of ukraine has brought a wartime energy transition to europe the continent's decades long timelines for overhauling energy supply systems that support more than 440 million people are now being revved up under extraordinary duress policy is changing in real time as political leaders in capitals across the europe adopt new positions by the day and missiles land on kyiv as a deputy prime minister in moscow threatened on monday march 7 to stop flows of natural gas through the nord stream 1 pipeline which supplied 38 per cent of gas imported into the european union last year policymakers in brussels were putting finishing touches on a new plan to slash russian gas by more than two thirds over the next nine months in washington and london meanwhile bans on russian oil were announced on tuesday without waiting for european allies to move the posture of the eu's biggest economy has changed rapidly during the crisis with germany committing 200 billion euros s 297 billion to bring forward its goal of 100 per cent renewable energy by more than a decade if europe before the war had a long term political agenda to remake its energy resources over decades in response to global warming now the energy question is even more urgent what can be done by next winter and beyond in the name of cutting off the russian economy from its largest source of trade or perhaps even by next month if russian president vladimir putin makes good on threats to respond to eu and us sanctions with an energy embargo of his own the war in ukraine has already revealed that the modern financial system can be weaponised in ways never before seen now the same might be true of the energy transition europe is suddenly going to test what is possible on a war footing in a rush almost unprecedented in living memory now that the world war ii generation is nearly gone what follows is a guide to the new range of possibilities to suddenly shift away from russia's fossil fuels europe spends as much as us 1 billion s 1 36 billion a day to pay for coal gas and oil imported from russia indirectly funding the war machine that's rolling through ukraine because of what's happening in russia there are no taboos in the choices member states can make frans timmermans the eu's climate czar told environment committee lawmakers on monday he left it up to each country to decide whether they will make up for burning more fossil fuels in the short term by boosting investments in renewables in practice both will happen an uptick in coal oil and gas imported from non russian sources as well as a push to expand solar wind and nuclear coal is the easiest problem to solve even with prices running to us 400 per tonne the us and australia can together replace 70 per cent of the russian coal imported into the eu right now says brian ricketts secretary general at euracoal a trade group for europe's coal industry running existing coal plants at full throttle and postponing the retirements of others could help reduce russian gas imports by 15 per cent this year according to the international energy agency buying coal from other sources will probably increase europe's costs by about 20 billion euros compared with purchasing russian supplies according to bloomberg estimates reflecting current prices for the fuel and carbon emissions in the eu oil is politically trickier but in a global market it's a question of where to buy from and how much to pay spare capacity in saudi arabia united arab emirates and iraq could theoretically make up for russian oil imports to europe within months but the first two countries have signalled they're not interested in ramping up production removing russian oil from from major markets means prices will likely continue rising with traders predicting us 200 a barrel by the end of the month at that price based on bloomberg estimates the eu would have to spend an extra 80 billion euros to purchase the crude it would have gotten from russia this year although shale could ramp up production faster than it is us producers have repeatedly said they will put maintaining profits above output growth depending on how far western powers are willing to go oil from sanctioned iran and venezuela could be brought back to global markets a pair of senior us officials went to caracas this weekend to discuss easing oil restrictions with representatives of venezuelan president nicolas maduro's government according to people familiar with the trip the dilemma around coal and oil isn't so much their availability as their impact on the planet and the eu's world leading climate policies burning coal instead of gas would increase the eu's emissions by about 8 per cent based on bloomberg calculations but a short term increase in emissions may be the least bad option since europe isn't planning to build new coal power plants as part of its response to the war in ukraine any additional pollution created by new coal and oil imports can be cut once green replacements are scaled up that's not the case with natural gas plans to boost alternative sources of the fuel relied on to heat millions of european homes mean building infrastructure that will lock in gas consumption for decades while some countries may try to extract more gas at home it's possible based on iea estimates for europe to cut russian gas imports by a third or even by half by next winter that will require more piped gas from azerbaijan norway and algeria while also buying more shipments of liquefied natural gas and fixing leaky pipeline infrastructure the last step would also help stem methane emissions a major source of global warming bruegel a brussels based think tank went even further by suggesting the eu could survive next winter if all russian pipeline imports were halted though it would require painful measures including power rationing filling up gas storage from non russian sources would cost between 60 billion euros to 100 billion euros according to aurora energy research neither suggestion for the near future of natural gas is as ambitious as what the eu itself is now contemplating by replacing about 102 out of 155 billion cubic metre it would have imported from russian this year the proposal heavily relies on being able to buy lng instead pitting europe against major buyers such as japan and china the largest global importer of the liquefied fuel policies related to europe's green deal such as subsidies for heat pumps or mandates for retrofitting old buildings will also need to be accelerated in the most extreme scenario countries may also have to turn to rationing in the us during the 1970s oil embargo this took the form of allowing only cars with even numbered licence plates to fill up on fuel on even numbered dates britons in the aftermath of wwii received fuel coupons depending on the needs of their profession with doctors receiving more allowances the imposition of rationing came as an understanding that you need to make sacrifices on the homefront so that we can succeed on the battlefront says meg jacobs a research scholar at princeton university it helps to link sacrifices to the preservation of democracy that is exactly what ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy has done electrifying transportation more quickly might not help in the moment but can permanently reduce oil consumption in the longer term even without any additional policies the clean energy researchers at bloombergnef expect electric vehicle sales in europe to quadruple by 2030 if policymakers pour money into the industry in response to the russian invasion that rate could increase significantly in norway for example ev sales now make up 15 per cent of the total thanks to strong incentives the country's oil demand has dropped by 10 per cent from 2011 levels when it comes to fossil fuels europe is bound by the rules of the global energy market but the clean energy possibilities are more open prices of raw materials for solar panels and wind turbines are also rising though nowhere near as much as the surge in fossil fuels plus a clean energy expansion dovetails with policies already in place the eu planned to cut carbon emissions 55 per cent by 2030 at a cost of 350 billion euros in energy infrastructure investment per year that would be enough to reduce its overall gas consumption by 30 per cent the longer term way out of this is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels as quickly as possible says michael bradshaw professor of global energy at university of warwick of all the green solutions available solar is the easiest to speed up panels are relatively easy to install and rooftops all over europe sit empty the region could boost deployment by as much as 50 per cent this year just by making approvals more efficient according to jenny chase head of solar analysis at bloombergnef speeding up permits mandating that all new homes come with rooftop panels and ensuring buildings that produce more solar can sell it back to the grid would be enough to prompt the installation of as much as 45 gigawatts of solar this year according to estimates from bloombergnef that's six years ahead of schedule based on its previous projections and would be enough electricity to power millions of homes expanding wind power ahead of schedule will prove more difficult it takes much longer to build turbines than solar panels because the gigantic blades must travel long distances the industry already faces significant supply chain delays says gary bills regional director for europe middle east and africa at energy consultant k2 management but reforming the european approach to wind permits can still make a difference in the longer term according to bills by boosting deployment as much as 20 per cent many areas of italy still require developers to bring printed applications down to a local planning office sometimes costing tens of thousands of euros for the paperwork alone they just need to be digitised somehow says viktoriya kerelska head of advocacy at industry group wind europe if wind farms take up to two years to build nuclear plants require at least a decade the most immediate option would be prolonging europe's existing fleet says yves desbazeille director general of the brussels nuclear industry association foratom extending the lives of three reactors set to shut by the end of 2022 could cut germany's total gas consumption by about 3 per cent over the next two years based on bloombergnef projections doing so would mark a rupture with germany's longstanding drive to eliminate its nuclear power in recent weeks as a result of the war in ukraine the german government briefly considered extending nuclear power's life and possibly reactivating mothballed reactors that process would entail sourcing uranium a difficult task if the goal is to add nuclear capacity back before next winter especially with russia cut off as a potential source german plants slated for deactivation will technically retain their operating licenses beyond year end but will probably need to pass some safety reviews by state regulators according to nicolas wendler a spokesman for the german nuclear industry group kerntechnik deutschland beyond short term measures to ramp up zero emission energy europe will also need to invest in new technologies if it wants to more rapidly abandon all fossil fuels as a way to eliminate russia's pull over the bloc both gas and coal continue to play a role in eu grids because they are crucial backups when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine as batteries have become cheaper however they are beginning to replace the need for fossil fuels by soaking up excess renewable electricity that can be released during peak demands the problem is that more than 80 per cent of the world's lithium ion batteries made each year end up in electric cars rather than on grids without a huge amount of growth in batteries on the grid we just simply can't build enough renewables because the grid itself can't take it says alex o'cinneide chief executive of london based renewables investor gore street capital having more of our cell production going to energy storage rather than evs for the environment and for geopolitical reasons is much more impactful europe lags behind places like california and australia when it comes to grid batteries but those examples show that operators can add a lot more storage if supported by government policies crucially grid scale batteries don't have to only rely on lithium ion technology new and emerging ideas that use less expensive metals like iron could eventually make batteries even more attractive after the past year's surge in the gas prices hydrogen made from renewable energy has become cheaper than versions made with fossil fuel as part of its climate agenda the eu already planned to invest heavily in green hydrogen now it could go even further it takes as little as two years for project planning manufacturing and construction according to meredith annex an analyst at bloombergnef the bigger challenge will be scaling up by the end of this year global manufacturers will be able to produce enough electrolyzers devices that split water into hydrogen and oxygen atoms to consume 13 5 gigawatts of clean electricity but that's a fraction of what's needed to replace europe's existing demand for hydrogen produced from natural gas making that much hydrogen would require 60 gigawatts of green power if the machines were running all the time and more than 200 gigawatts in a more realistic scenario where the electricity comes from solar or onshore wind farms according to bloombergnef producing more renewable energy isn't the same as getting it where it's most needed if europe speeds up major renewable energy projects it will also need more giant cables to move the power around those structures will help take the abundant wind resource from northern europe down to the cities farther south by the end of the decade cables could stretch across the mediterranean sea to bring solar power from tunisia and egypt to italy and greece there aren't many good options for speeding up these improvements to the grid all the current manufacturing capacity for large cables is already spoken for says christopher guerin chief executive of french cable maker nexans sa it can take at least two years to increase manufacturing capacity and up to three years to build a major cable project such as crossing the north sea the cable business like batteries is also reliant on metals like copper that are in limited supply globally still with clear mandates from the government on projects and planning the industry could make investments now that will enable faster deployment in the latter half of the decade nothing is impossible guerin said it's all a matter of time and investment follow the straits times' live coverage

        "content": "singapore a digital platform that allows businesses to buy and sell carbon credits was launched on wednesday march 16 by singapore based carbon exchange and marketplace climate impact x cix called project marketplace the platform will allow firms to discover compare and purchase carbon credits from various projects around the world for a start the marketplace will mainly feature carbon credits from nature based solutions such as forest conservation efforts as forests can take in planet warming carbon dioxide co2 from the air through photosynthesis every unit of co2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit there are currently about 10 to 15 such projects listed on the platform including the tambopata bahuaja biodiversity reserve located in the peruvian amazon the agroforestry project which spans an area roughly the size of los angeles entails the restoration of degraded areas there help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production reducing their need to cut down trees in the area cix chief executive mikkel larsen said credits from nature based solutions typically range from us 12 s 16 35 to us 17 per credit he said he expects those listed on project marketplace will be on the higher end although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier mr larsen also said that other types of carbon projects such as those that use technology to suck up co2 from the atmosphere will be listed on project marketplace in the second half of this year the global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity co2 produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions cix which was jointly established last year by dbs bank singapore exchange standard chartered and temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market once the credits purchased are used to offset a firm's emissions the platform can also be used to retire the credits which means a credit is taken off the market never to be traded or swapped again so as to ensure carbon savings are not double counted the launch of the marketplace comes as the government announced last month that large emitters in singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can from 2024 buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions mr larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market especially during periods of uncertainty responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible lasting climate impact our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits said mr larsen to achieve that goal we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data insights and practical guidance to our wider community for example the project marketplace platform will feature third party ratings supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data of the various carbon projects listed on it cix said it works with sylvera a firm that provides data on nature based offset projects sylvera provides information about each project such as the permanence of the carbon removal co benefits of nature based projects and risk global demand for carbon credits is expected to grow following an outcome at last november's climate change conference cop26 that allows countries to buy carbon credits to meet the climate targets they set for themselves under the paris agreement this has made the set up of carbon projects more profitable for land developers who may choose to conserve a forest to sell carbon credits instead of cutting it down for oil palm or other crops but observers have pointed out that such projects need to be established in consultation with indigenous communities living on the land international media outlets have reported on how a controversial carbon trading deal in malaysian borneo was inked with no due diligence or consultation with the indigenous groups living there asked how cix will ensure that credits sold on its project marketplace platform will respect the rights of affected communities mr larsen said social integrity was a key component of cix's assessment of a project before it is listed on the platform he also pointed to cix's independent international advisory council which provides views on the latest science policy and market application the council comprises various experts from academics to non government organisations observers and representatives from global verification bodies we also want to have representation from indigenous communities he said acknowledging that this was a complex issue that varies among countries he said cix was taking steps to assess the various projects in consultation with its advisory council that is ultimately our

discuss the dissolution of parliament with the party s other top leaders datuk seri ismail who had previously appeared resistant to calls for snap polls on saturday looked to have aligned his views with that of his party chief ahmad zahid hamidi who has been agitating for snap polls if we are confident of victory we will not wait even a second to dissolve parliament to hold the next elections mr ismail said to a roar of applause from the party s over 5 500 delegates towards the end of the four day assembly mr ismail referred to the top five of the party's leadership to discuss parliament's dissolution comprising zahid deputy president mohamad hasan and three vice presidents mr ismail is the most senior vice president and third in the party hierarchy mr ismail also called for the party to close its ranks echoing calls from zahid and other party leaders who are calling for a general election to be held before an overdue party elections are held in his closing address zahid candidly appeared to indicate that mr ismail might not necessarily lose his premiership should parliament be dissolved he ruled out both himself and najib as they face a slew of court cases as contenders for the top job however he asked his deputy datuk seri mohamad to maybe wait until the 16th general election the next general election will be the 15th one by hierarchy mr mohamad as the no 2 in the party should become the prime minister candidate should zahid rule himself out of the top job later at a news conference zahid was asked if mr ismail has been identified as the party's prime minister candidate for the upcoming national vote zahid's reply we have so many candidates here referring to party leaders in the room including mr ismail and mr mohamad but as you know in johor our poster boy was hasni but we all know the result as you know pm is ismail sabri but i don t think the poster boy is the material to promote right now zahid added zahid was referring to datuk hasni mohammad who was named the candidate for johor menteri besar or the poster boy in local electoral parlance should umno win last saturday's johor state polls but the johor ruler picked another candidate as the johor menteri besar the remarks by mr ismail in his winding up speech at the assembly came just before the delegates passed resolutions to push for snap polls in the second half of this year and to also postpone the party elections until snap polls are concluded the delegates represent grassroots leaders from the party's 191 divisions throughout the country umno deputy president mohamad announced the passing of the resolutions without any objections from the delegates effectively indicating that the party would push for elections to be held after july this year when a confidence and supply agreement between mr ismail and opposition alliance pakatan harapan ph expires zahid an ally of former premier najib razak has been leading a camp in umno pushing for snap polls as they believe an election this year would see umno led barisan nasional win an outright majority to form the next federal government the opposition parties are divided between ph and perikatan nasional alliance leading to their heavy defeats in the melaka and johor state polls both zahid and najib are facing multiple graft charges and najib had already been convicted in one of his court cases related to the 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb scandal mr ismail and several umno leaders who are in his administration were resisting the idea as they attempted to preserve their seven month old administration and had wanted to delay general elections until after party elections are held mr ismail is the first premier who is not chief of his own party and going by hierarchical convention he would not be the coalition s prime minister candidate should bn win a fresh mandate at the next elections an internal umno election would have allowed mr ismail a chance to contest the top job against zahid umno s party elections have been due since 2021 but the amendment to its constitution passed by the assembly on saturday means party polls will now likely be pushed to take place six months after snap polls are conducted thus pushing it effectively to next year mr ismail who appeared sidelined throughout the four day assembly as party leaders aligned to zahid amped the pressure to call for snap polls was surprisingly given the stage to address delegates before the assembly concluded he used the opportunity to announce a slew of government policies including a new minimum wage of rm 1 500 s 486 starting may 1 before reiterating his loyalty and commitment to the party mr ismail currently leads a mixed coalition government consisting of both bn and their electoral rivals pn the government only has a four seat majority mr ismail ascended to the top job only in august last year after zahid ruled himself out to focus on his court cases while mr mohamad was not eligible as he was not a member

        "content": "dhaka the daily star asia news network on dec 4 last year in the immediate aftermath of the crumbling of evaly's empire of sand celebrities rafiath rashid mithila tahsan khan and shabnam faria were sued by a customer of the e commerce platform for aiding and abetting fraud over the next few weeks the issue became something of a sensation on social media sparking conversations in some intellectual quarters about the premise of the lawsuit about whether the three very popular celebrities could be held responsible for evaly's wrongdoings though the conversation died down soon as is always the case on social media the issue stuck with me what really is the ethics of celebrity endorsements which have become an integral and rather indispensable part of the equation in this current phase of capitalism before we get to an answer to this let's consider what actually happens when a celebrity figure or an influencer endorses a brand or business in exchange for money it's simple really a celebrity throughout their career builds up a rapport with the public this imbues the celebrity with a certain kind of aura there's the trustworthy celebrity the bad boy the family first person the celebrity with professional expertise and the list goes on this rapport or social capital is then sold to a company in exchange for the company's money the transaction here then is one of monetary capital for social capital and vice versa beyond just face value when a celebrity appears on our screens representing a company we immediately link the celebrity's brand value or aura with that of the company the three celebrities in question over the evaly scam all possess the same trustworthy sort of face value mithila is widely regarded as a strong sincere feminist personality tahsan khan has a carefully curated brand name for being a kind and gentle soul and shabnam faria comes off as a sincere and loyal person thanks to all the roles she has played on screen over the years if we agree that a popular figure's brand value is not just a result of their real selves but can also be calculated quite carefully and with intent we can shed light on how this element works in the discourse of celebrity endorsements there are two layers of deception that operate here on one hand the performer artiste poses as being different from how they are in order to obtain a certain kind of social capital from their audience for the second layer the artiste uses that social capital to strike deals with brands and drive their audience towards said brands given how the evaly scam played out the more pressing concerns of the issue came to the fore quite forcefully but this issue is not just limited to fraudulence when a celebrity known for their good health lends their social capital to a beverage company whose product can have debilitating effects on consumers' health is it not the same kind of deception you see given how society works today a brand cannot build a relationship with its market without a little help from figures who already have a connection with the people seen this way a celebrity who has once signed the contract to endorse a brand can no longer be seen separately from it or from the consequences of its business so when things come crumbling down the affiliated celebrities cannot just be allowed to run and hide claiming they didn't know any better brands themselves are aware of this and don't wait even a second before cutting off their prized endorsee when a controversy develops in the latter's personal life case in point cristiano ronaldo and nike another case study that sheds light on this issue is that of scarlett johansson's role as an ambassador for both israeli soda maker sodastream and the ingo oxfam after online activists found out that one of sodastream's factories is located in an illegal settlement on the west bank they started hounding johansson for her connection to the company a criticism which also extended to oxfam for their connection with her as this case illustrates when the activities of corporations stop being innocent in the name of doing business and raising a country's gdp should not the role of celebrities in enhancing the corporations' fate be scrutinised as well as the activities of corporations are deemed not innocent due to those being done only for profit shouldn't the role of celebrities in enhancing the corporations' success be scrutinised as well but beyond just scrutiny we ought to move into a culture wherein before signing a deal a celebrity conducts background research on a brand the same way brands do quite extensively when taking a celebrity on board and this fact checking exercise shouldn't be limited to legal matters or instances of public backlash but also in terms of whether a celebrity's philosophy aligns with the company's if a self proclaimed nature lover signs up for a top five polluter for instance that's more than a little contradictory join

        "content": "moscow afp their economies rocked by conflict russian and ukrainian authorities have deployed different tactics to defend their weakened currencies with varying degrees of success the russian rouble which was trading around 80 to the dollar before moscow sent troops into ukraine on feb 24 lost 40 per cent of its value in the following days slumping to an unprecedented level of 150 to the dollar it has since clawed back much of that trading at around 105 roubles to the dollar seemingly having profited from talks between moscow and kyiv to end the conflict despite having been cut off from much of its foreign currency reserves due to western sanctions the russian central bank has nevertheless occasionally sold some to support the rouble together with strict capital controls that require exporters to sell most of their foreign currency to the central bank and limits on consumers accessing their holdings the measures appear to be working during the past 10 years the central bank intervened directly only several times which now works in favour of the market exchange rate stabilising said analyst alexander kudrin at investment bank aton the first signs of stabilisation are already appearing he added russian economy expert janis kluge at the berlin based swp think tank tweeted recently that the rouble was strengthening thanks to strict capital controls and large oil and gas revenues following the initial sanctions shock in ukraine which is under martial law the central bank has suspended all currency trading and set a fixed exchange rate of approximately 29 hryvnia to the dollar it also banned foreign currency withdrawals and most cross border payments mr volodymyr lepushynskyi director of monetary policy at the ukrainian central bank said officials had a plan already prepared in case of conflict we always hoped that we would not need to implement it but we were ready he told afp thanks to the experience of working in administrative constraints we had a clear understanding of what needs to be done to prevent destabilisation of the financial sector and to establish its effective operation under such circumstances finance minister sergiy marchenko recently said on ukrainian television that the central bank's measures created certain conditions under which there is exchange rate stability today he also noted that ukraine has received support from its international partners including the european union and world bank adding that the international monetary fund has approved a 1 4 billion emergency aid programme for ukraine mr ousmene mandeng a visiting fellow at the london school of economics warned that while the measures may be justified by the extreme circumstances they carry certain risks the suspension of foreign exchange trading is de facto equivalent to a price freeze and if prolonged can lead to a black market for foreign exchange and de facto multiple currency use he told afp a resumption of foreign exchange trading would be desirable to minimise implied distortions mr mandeng added noting that the ukrainian central bank had eased some restrictions and that some interbank foreign exchange market operations appear to be slowly resuming the central bank's mr lepushynskyi said it plans to relax restrictions as soon as it sees room to do so after the liberation of ukraine from russian invaders and the normalisation of the economic situation we will resume the full operation of the foreign exchange market and lift currency restrictions to pre war levels in the shortest possible time he said mr mandeng also noted that ukraine had about us 28 billion s 37 97 billion in foreign currency reserves at the beginning of the month that should offer some comfort for the short term but may eventually need to be replenished he said ukrainians fleeing the country with hryvnia in their pockets are facing the most direct problems due to lack of convertibility of the currency the european commission's executive vice president valdis dombrovskis said recently that the commission was working together with the european central bank to provide some kind of convertibility assistance so that people are able to convert at least certain amounts of their savings in hryvnia into euros join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

home her cows her family orchard all the land and belongings that her family has not seen since 2008 when russian troops forced them from their hometown during that year's russian georgian war i watch the ukraine news i remember 2008 and it makes me cry said ms marghishvili 57 who now lives in a camp for georgians displaced by that 2008 war georgia should be sanctioning russia blockading them boycotting their exports and for ms marghishvili the big mystery is why hasn't the georgian government already done that along russia's borders in post soviet countries such as georgia that remain caught between russian and western influence the russian invasion of ukraine has presented governments with a strategic dilemma apart from belarus none have backed the russian offensive nor have they strongly opposed it fearful of upsetting a dominant neighbour that is a major source of trade and remittances a guarantor of some countries' security and a potential aggressor to others a small mountainous country of 3 7 million people at the south eastern extreme of the european continent georgia is perhaps running the narrowest gauntlet russia invaded parts of georgia 14 years ago and russian troops still protect south ossetia and abkhazia two secessionist statelets that broke away from georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008 that has put russia in de facto control of roughly one fifth of georgian territory including the town in south ossetia where ms marghishvili once lived to the georgian government this precarious dynamic makes it unwise to speak out too strongly against russia lest russia turn on georgia next we live next to a volcano said mr giorgi khelashvili a lawmaker for georgia's ruling party georgian dream the volcano just erupted and it just happens that the lava is currently flowing down the other side of the mountain but this cautious approach has put the georgian government at odds with most of its population creating a far more pointed clash between majority opinion on ukraine and government policy than in most other european countries recent polling suggests nearly 60 per cent of georgians want a stronger stance on ukraine from their elected officials and many have hung ukrainian flags from their apartments and offices in tbilisi georgia's capital tens of thousands of georgians have rallied to support ukraine and to criticise the government's equivocal approach to a brotherly nation we have different lands and different countries but we have the same sky and we have the same enemy said mr dato turashvili a popular georgian novelist and one of many georgians flying a ukrainian flag outside his home the georgian government says 'it's better to be careful russia is dangerous' but that doesn't matter to the kremlin said mr turashvili if they take kyiv they will take tbilisi the government says the criticism is unfair since it has taken some measures that could anger russia days after the invasion began georgia submitted a rushed application for membership in the european union a largely symbolic indication of its pro western orientation since full membership is years away the government sent humanitarian aid to ukraine admitted more than 5 000 ukrainian refugees and voted in favour of a united nations resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine georgia has also admitted more than 30 000 russians since the war started of whom 12 000 have remained there with tbilisi joining istanbul as one of the primary destinations for the new wave of young russian exiles but despite rising anger from georgian society the georgian government has generally avoided condemning russia directly and has refused to impose sanctions on the russian economy the government has clashed with the country's ceremonial president who has taken a stronger position prevented a charter plane of georgian volunteers from flying to ukraine and blocked entry to several russian dissidents supporters of the government stance include the georgian orthodox church one of the country's most powerful civil institutions whose priests have historically criticised the liberal values they associate with the west we remember that russian troops are standing just 50km away said the reverend andrea jaghmaidze a spokesperson for the church referring to the boundary between georgia and south ossetia about 30 miles 48km distant therefore great wisdom should be shown so as not to place extra burden on the country but many georgians feel that it would be not only more dignified to take a more vocal stance but also more strategic by taking an ambiguous stance on ukraine georgia risks signalling to the west that it is uninterested in proper ties with europe and north america and therefore not worth the west's support said mr giorgi gakharia a former prime minister if your standing is not clear and if your standing is not values based then the brits the germans the french the americans will have questions mr gakharia said where does georgia stand in some cases the desire for a stronger stance against the russian state has morphed into anger at the new russian emigres who have found themselves in an intimidating environment citizens of the russian federation reads a flyer recently posted across central tbilisi you are not welcome here some georgian landlords have refused to rent apartments to russian tenants mr alexey voloshinov a 20 year old journalist for rosbalt a russian news organisation listed by the kremlin as a foreign agent said a landlord had refused him tenancy last week because we're russians and the russian soldiers killed her son in the russian georgian war in 2008 mr voloshinov said mr turashvili the novelist empathises with dissidents and journalists such as mr voloshinov his most famous novel flight from the ussr is about a group of georgian dissidents who tried to escape the soviet union in the 1980s but in a sign of the times even mr turashvili is wary of admitting too large a wave of russians like many georgians he worries that a majority have fled for financial reasons rather than any sincere opposition to the kremlin they have the best writers in

        "content": "washington nytimes in the first weeks of the first major european land war of the 21st century the united states has sent tank killing weapons to ukrainian forces but not fighter jets it is equipping embattled ukrainian troops with lightweight kamikaze attack drones but not at least in an obvious way conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade russia's technological advantage the white house will commit no us or nato planes to the skies above ukraine a move us officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration but it is providing ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying russian aircraft such is the tenuous balance the biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help ukraine lock russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de escalation navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions and sometimes tortured distinctions when it comes to what kinds of assistance washington should provide even as the situation on the ground evolves pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine pleads with congress and president joe biden to do more to help the balancing act informs every aspect of us policy about the war including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the russian economy the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to ukrainian troops the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether as mr biden did this past week to label president vladimir putin of russia as a war criminal cia officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted ukrainian military units according to us officials but as of now mr biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the united states did in afghanistan against the soviet union during the 1980s they have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation in part because nato supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in kyiv ukraine the new war has forced a recalculation on other fronts in one example us officials have floated the idea of turkey's government providing ukraine with the sophisticated s 400 anti aircraft system it is the very system made by russia that us officials punished turkey a nato ally for buying from moscow several years ago now us diplomats see a way to pull turkey away from its dance with russia and give the ukrainians one of the most powerful long range anti aircraft systems in existence in the white house and the pentagon there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows us officials acknowledge that the judgements of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point and that all that really matters is the judgement of one person mr putin on wednesday march 16 the task of articulating the intricacies of the us' military policy toward ukraine fell to a group of generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the house and senate armed services committees mr biden has made clear that he will not accede to zelensky's insistent pleas that nato impose a no fly zone over ukraine clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the united states and its allies in combat with russian forces and a required step for a no fly zone suppressing enemy anti aircraft weaponry would mean attacking russian air defence installations inside russian territory but during the closed door session lawmakers pressed members of the pentagon's joint staff about another flashpoint the administration's decision not to help supply ukraine with the mig 29 fighter jets that poland has offered and that mr zelensky has said his forces desperately need administration officials have said the move would be escalatory and according to people briefed on the exchanges the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push mr putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the united states as a co belligerent in the war intelligence officials have in fact told the administration that the migs could trigger a russian move against nato during the congressional briefing the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a mig 29 to threaten russian soil in contrast to a javelin anti tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield a mig 29 could fly from kyiv to moscow in a matter of minutes the generals said a capability that the kremlin might see as a direct threat the same day the white house put forth another consideration that to be delivered to ukraine the migs would have to take off from an air base in a nato country possibly inviting retaliation on nato territory by the russians some us officials assert that as a matter of international law the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the ukrainian army has made the united states a co belligerent an argument that some legal experts dispute but while mr putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighbouring countries nato allies where the equipment originates that could change us officials said especially if mr putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing it is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for ukraine said ms andrea kendall taylor a former senior intelligence official who specialised in russia and is now at the centre for a new american security they are trying to figure out how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with russia planes with pilots might be off the table but armed drones are not this past week mr biden announced that the united states would ship small switchblade drones to ukraine that could be used to blow up russian armoured vehicles the single use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink and can be controlled to dive bomb tanks or troops self destructing when they explode unlike the large predator and reaper drones used for decades in iraq afghanistan pakistan and other countries the portable drones pose no threat to russian soil still the white house authorised an initial shipment of only 100 of them to ukraine a small batch that could be intended to see how mr putin reacts to their deployment on the ukrainian front lines depending on the response hundreds or thousands more could be on the way the proposal for turkey to supply ukraine with russian made s 400 anti aircraft systems would also test what mr putin is willing to accept from nato and how far a nato ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing ukraine the idea came up when ms wendy sherman the deputy secretary of state visited turkey two weeks ago ms sherman declined to talk about her discussions a different senior us official said the united states knew the proposal would anger mr putin ukraine already uses turkish made drones but turkey is worried that providing the anti aircraft systems could make the country a target of russia's wrath the ukraine war features tank columns and trenches all features of europe's bloody conflicts of the past century thus far there is little evidence that the united states or russia is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace days before the war began there was a flurry of cyberattacks on ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries including one that was found and partly neutralised by microsoft a european satellite system sometimes used by the ukrainian military was also hit knocking out service although it is still unclear whether the russians carried out the attack what has been missing thus far is a large scale russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside ukraine which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes until the invasion began us cyber command had a unit based in kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks it is now operating from a nearby nato country there is fragmentary evidence that the united states and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched but action seems to have been limited inside the biden administration there is a view that mr putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the us financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the united states and its allies unless and until that happens the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation especially given the risks to the us economy and financial system if russia were to target them the water in afghanistan must boil at the right temperature pakistan's then president general mohammad zia ul haq told his intelligence chief as pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their gruelling battle against soviet troops in neighbouring afghanistan in other words hot enough to convince the

home her cows her family orchard all the land and belongings that her family has not seen since 2008 when russian troops forced them from their hometown during that year's russian georgian war i watch the ukraine news i remember 2008 and it makes me cry said ms marghishvili 57 who now lives in a camp for georgians displaced by that 2008 war georgia should be sanctioning russia blockading them boycotting their exports and for ms marghishvili the big mystery is why hasn't the georgian government already done that along russia's borders in post soviet countries such as georgia that remain caught between russian and western influence the russian invasion of ukraine has presented governments with a strategic dilemma apart from belarus none have backed the russian offensive nor have they strongly opposed it fearful of upsetting a dominant neighbour that is a major source of trade and remittances a guarantor of some countries' security and a potential aggressor to others a small mountainous country of 3 7 million people at the south eastern extreme of the european continent georgia is perhaps running the narrowest gauntlet russia invaded parts of georgia 14 years ago and russian troops still protect south ossetia and abkhazia two secessionist statelets that broke away from georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008 that has put russia in de facto control of roughly one fifth of georgian territory including the town in south ossetia where ms marghishvili once lived to the georgian government this precarious dynamic makes it unwise to speak out too strongly against russia lest russia turn on georgia next we live next to a volcano said mr giorgi khelashvili a lawmaker for georgia's ruling party georgian dream the volcano just erupted and it just happens that the lava is currently flowing down the other side of the mountain but this cautious approach has put the georgian government at odds with most of its population creating a far more pointed clash between majority opinion on ukraine and government policy than in most other european countries recent polling suggests nearly 60 per cent of georgians want a stronger stance on ukraine from their elected officials and many have hung ukrainian flags from their apartments and offices in tbilisi georgia's capital tens of thousands of georgians have rallied to support ukraine and to criticise the government's equivocal approach to a brotherly nation we have different lands and different countries but we have the same sky and we have the same enemy said mr dato turashvili a popular georgian novelist and one of many georgians flying a ukrainian flag outside his home the georgian government says 'it's better to be careful russia is dangerous' but that doesn't matter to the kremlin said mr turashvili if they take kyiv they will take tbilisi the government says the criticism is unfair since it has taken some measures that could anger russia days after the invasion began georgia submitted a rushed application for membership in the european union a largely symbolic indication of its pro western orientation since full membership is years away the government sent humanitarian aid to ukraine admitted more than 5 000 ukrainian refugees and voted in favour of a united nations resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine georgia has also admitted more than 30 000 russians since the war started of whom 12 000 have remained there with tbilisi joining istanbul as one of the primary destinations for the new wave of young russian exiles but despite rising anger from georgian society the georgian government has generally avoided condemning russia directly and has refused to impose sanctions on the russian economy the government has clashed with the country's ceremonial president who has taken a stronger position prevented a charter plane of georgian volunteers from flying to ukraine and blocked entry to several russian dissidents supporters of the government stance include the georgian orthodox church one of the country's most powerful civil institutions whose priests have historically criticised the liberal values they associate with the west we remember that russian troops are standing just 50km away said the reverend andrea jaghmaidze a spokesperson for the church referring to the boundary between georgia and south ossetia about 30 miles 48km distant therefore great wisdom should be shown so as not to place extra burden on the country but many georgians feel that it would be not only more dignified to take a more vocal stance but also more strategic by taking an ambiguous stance on ukraine georgia risks signalling to the west that it is uninterested in proper ties with europe and north america and therefore not worth the west's support said mr giorgi gakharia a former prime minister if your standing is not clear and if your standing is not values based then the brits the germans the french the americans will have questions mr gakharia said where does georgia stand in some cases the desire for a stronger stance against the russian state has morphed into anger at the new russian emigres who have found themselves in an intimidating environment citizens of the russian federation reads a flyer recently posted across central tbilisi you are not welcome here some georgian landlords have refused to rent apartments to russian tenants mr alexey voloshinov a 20 year old journalist for rosbalt a russian news organisation listed by the kremlin as a foreign agent said a landlord had refused him tenancy last week because we're russians and the russian soldiers killed her son in the russian georgian war in 2008 mr voloshinov said mr turashvili the novelist empathises with dissidents and journalists such as mr voloshinov his most famous novel flight from the ussr is about a group of georgian dissidents who tried to escape the soviet union in the 1980s but in a sign of the times even mr turashvili is wary of

        "content": "washington nytimes in the first weeks of the first major european land war of the 21st century the united states has sent tank killing weapons to ukrainian forces but not fighter jets it is equipping embattled ukrainian troops with lightweight kamikaze attack drones but not at least in an obvious way conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade russia's technological advantage the white house will commit no us or nato planes to the skies above ukraine a move us officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration but it is providing ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying russian aircraft such is the tenuous balance the biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help ukraine lock russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de escalation navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions and sometimes tortured distinctions when it comes to what kinds of assistance washington should provide even as the situation on the ground evolves pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine pleads with congress and president joe biden to do more to help the balancing act informs every aspect of us policy about the war including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the russian economy the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to ukrainian troops the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether as mr biden did this past week to label president vladimir putin of russia as a war criminal cia officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted ukrainian military units according to us officials but as of now mr biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the united states did in afghanistan against the soviet union during the 1980s they have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation in part because nato supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in kyiv ukraine the new war has forced a recalculation on other fronts in one example us officials have floated the idea of turkey's government providing ukraine with the sophisticated s 400 anti aircraft system it is the very system made by russia that us officials punished turkey a nato ally for buying from moscow several years ago now us diplomats see a way to pull turkey away from its dance with russia and give the ukrainians one of the most powerful long range anti aircraft systems in existence in the white house and the pentagon there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows us officials acknowledge that the judgements of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point and that all that really matters is the judgement of one person mr putin on wednesday march 16 the task of articulating the intricacies of the us' military policy toward ukraine fell to a group of generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the house and senate armed services committees mr biden has made clear that he will not accede to zelensky's insistent pleas that nato impose a no fly zone over ukraine clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the united states and its allies in combat with russian forces and a required step for a no fly zone suppressing enemy anti aircraft weaponry would mean attacking russian air defence installations inside russian territory but during the closed door session lawmakers pressed members of the pentagon's joint staff about another flashpoint the administration's decision not to help supply ukraine with the mig 29 fighter jets that poland has offered and that mr zelensky has said his forces desperately need administration officials have said the move would be escalatory and according to people briefed on the exchanges the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push mr putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the united states as a co belligerent in the war intelligence officials have in fact told the administration that the migs could trigger a russian move against nato during the congressional briefing the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a mig 29 to threaten russian soil in contrast to a javelin anti tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield a mig 29 could fly from kyiv to moscow in a matter of minutes the generals said a capability that the kremlin might see as a direct threat the same day the white house put forth another consideration that to be delivered to ukraine the migs would have to take off from an air base in a nato country possibly inviting retaliation on nato territory by the russians some us officials assert that as a matter of international law the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the ukrainian army has made the united states a co belligerent an argument that some legal experts dispute but while mr putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighbouring countries nato allies where the equipment originates that could change us officials said especially if mr putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing it is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for ukraine said ms andrea kendall taylor a former senior intelligence official who specialised in russia and is now at the centre for a new american security they are trying to figure out how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with russia planes with pilots might be off the table but armed drones are not this past week mr biden announced that the united states would ship small switchblade drones to ukraine that could be used to blow up russian armoured vehicles the single use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink and can be controlled to dive bomb tanks or troops self destructing when they explode unlike the large predator and reaper drones used for decades in iraq afghanistan pakistan and other countries the portable drones pose no threat to russian soil still the white house authorised an initial shipment of only 100 of them to ukraine a small batch that could be intended to see how mr putin reacts to their deployment on the ukrainian front lines depending on the response hundreds or thousands more could be on the way the proposal for turkey to supply ukraine with russian made s 400 anti aircraft systems would also test what mr putin is willing to accept from nato and how far a nato ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing ukraine the idea came up when ms wendy sherman the deputy secretary of state visited turkey two weeks ago ms sherman declined to talk about her discussions a different senior us official said the united states knew the proposal would anger mr putin ukraine already uses turkish made drones but turkey is worried that providing the anti aircraft systems could make the country a target of russia's wrath the ukraine war features tank columns and trenches all features of europe's bloody conflicts of the past century thus far there is little evidence that the united states or russia is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace days before the war began there was a flurry of cyberattacks on ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries including one that was found and partly neutralised by microsoft a european satellite system sometimes used by the ukrainian military was also hit knocking out service although it is still unclear whether the russians carried out the attack what has been missing thus far is a large scale russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside ukraine which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes until the invasion began us cyber command had a unit based in kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks it is now operating from a nearby nato country there is fragmentary evidence that the united states and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched but action seems to have been limited inside the biden administration there is a view that mr putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the us financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the united states and its allies unless and until that happens the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation especially given the risks to the us economy and financial system if russia were to target them the water in afghanistan must boil at the right temperature pakistan's then president general mohammad zia ul haq told his intelligence chief as pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their gruelling battle against soviet troops in neighbouring afghanistan in other words hot enough to convince the russians that the country was not worth the struggle but not so hot as to provoke a broader war in the region the weapons that helped turn the tide of that conflict shoulder fired stinger surface to air missiles are now being unloaded from cargo planes in nato countries and delivered to ukrainian troops on the front lines to help keep russia from controlling the skies given russia's bloody history with stinger missiles us officials have been wary of advertising their use in ukraine this month when general mark milley chair of the joint chiefs of staff visited an airfield near ukraine's border where stingers were being unloaded reporters travelling with him were barred from disclosing the whereabouts of the base even after two senior us officials told the house armed services committee during a public hearing that stinger missiles were among the munitions being sent to ukraine spokespeople avoided using the s word from the lecterns at the white house and pentagon until

companies to bolster their sustainability records as the climate crisis deepens businesses and consumers are joining non profit groups and governments in a global tree planting boom last year saw billions of trees planted in scores of countries around the world these efforts can be a triple win providing livelihoods absorbing and locking away planet warming carbon dioxide co2 and improving the health of ecosystems but when done poorly the projects can worsen the very problems they were meant to solve planting the wrong trees in the wrong place can actually reduce biodiversity speeding extinctions and making ecosystems far less resilient addressing biodiversity loss already a global crisis akin to climate change is becoming more and more urgent extinction rates are surging an estimated million species are at risk of disappearing many within decades and ecosystem collapse doesn't just threaten animals and plants it imperils the food and water supplies that humans rely on amid that worsening crisis companies and countries are increasingly investing in tree planting that carpets large areas with commercial non native species in the name of fighting climate change these trees sock away carbon but provide little support to the webs of life that once thrived in those areas you're creating basically a sterile landscape said paul smith who runs botanic gardens conservation international an umbrella group that works to prevent plant extinctions if people want to plant trees let's also make it a positive for biodiversity there's a rule of thumb in the tree planting world one should plant the right tree in the right place some add for the right reason but according to interviews with a range of players scientists policy experts forestry companies and tree planting organisations people often disagree on what right means for some it's big tree farms for carbon storage and timber for others it's providing fruit trees to small scale farmers for others still it's allowing native species to regenerate the best efforts try to address a range of needs according to restoration experts but it can be hard to reconcile competing interests it's kind of the wild west said forrest fleischman a professor of environmental policy at the university of minnesota harm in the name of doing good' there is not enough land on earth to tackle climate change with trees alone but if paired with drastic cuts in fossil fuels trees can be an important natural solution they absorb co2 through pores in their leaves and stash it away in their branches and trunks though trees also release carbon when they burn or rot that ability to collect co2 is why forests are often called carbon sinks in central africa totalenergies the french oil and gas giant has announced plans to plant trees on 40 000 hectares in the republic of congo the project on the bat k plateau a rolling mosaic of grasses and wooded savanna with patches of denser forests would sequester more than 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over 20 years according to the company total is committing to the development of natural carbon sinks in africa said nicolas terraz who was then total's senior vice president for africa exploration and production in a company news release on the project in 2021 these activities build on the priority initiatives taken by the group to avoid and reduce emissions in line with its ambition to get to net zero by 2050 to achieve net zero companies must remove at least as much carbon from the air as they release many like totalenergies are turning to trees for help with that on the bat k plateau an acacia species from australia intended for selective logging will cover a large area the project part of a congolese government program to expand forest cover and increase carbon storage would create jobs the company said and ultimately broaden the ecosystem's biodiversity as local species are allowed to grow in over decades but scientists warn that the plan may be an example of one of the worst kinds of forestation efforts planting trees where they would not naturally occur these projects can devastate biodiversity threaten water supplies and even increase temperatures because in some cases trees absorb heat that grasslands or in other parts of the world snow would have reflected we don't want to cause harm in the name of doing good said bethanie walder executive director of the society for ecological restoration a global non profit the bat k plateau is one of the least studied ecosystems in africa according to paula nieto quintano an environmental scientist who has focused on the region its importance for local livelihoods its ecology and ecosystem functions are poorly understood nieto said those who study forest restoration emphasise that trees are not a cure all i fear that many corporations and governments are seeing this as an easy way out said robin chazdon a professor of tropical forest restoration at the university of the sunshine coast in australia they don't necessarily have to work as hard to reduce their emissions because they can just say 'oh we're offsetting that by planting trees' 'there have been bad actors' all trees store carbon but their other benefits vary widely depending on the species and where it's planted eucalyptus for instance grows fast and straight making it a lucrative lumber product native to australia and a few islands to the north its leaves feed koalas which evolved to tolerate a potent poison they contain but in africa and south america where the trees are widely grown for timber fuel and increasingly carbon storage they provide far less value to wildlife they are also blamed for depleting water and worsening wildfires experts acknowledge that forest restoration and carbon sequestration are complex and that commercial species have a role to play people need timber a renewable product with a lower carbon footprint than concrete or steel they need paper and fuel for cooking planting fast growing species for harvest can sometimes help preserve surrounding native forests and by strategically adding native species tree farms can help biodiversity by creating wildlife corridors to link disconnected habitat areas this restoration movement can't happen without the private sector said michael becker head of communications at 1t org a group created by the world economic forum to push for the conservation and growth of 1 trillion trees with help from private investment historically there have been bad actors but we need to bring them into the fold and doing the right thing a challenge is that helping biodiversity doesn't offer the financial return of carbon storage or timber markets many governments have set standards for reforestation efforts but they often provide broad leeway in wales one of the most deforested countries in europe the government is offering incentives for tree planting but growers need only include 25 per cent native species to qualify for government subsidies in kenya and brazil rows of eucalyptus grow on land that was once ecologically rich forest and savanna in peru a company called reforesta per is planting trees on degraded amazonian land but it's increasingly using cloned eucalyptus and teak intended for export investors prefer them because they bring better prices said enrique toledo general manager of reforesta per they are well known species internationally and there is an unsatisfied demand for wood when researchers from university college london and the university of edinburgh evaluated national commitments toward reforestation and restoration they found that 45 per cent involved planting vast monocultures of trees as profitable enterprises 'the same species all over the world' when businesses promise to plant a tree for every purchase of a given product they typically do so via non profit groups that work with communities around the world the support may reforest after wildfires or provide fruit and nut trees to farmers but even these projects can compromise biodiversity the planet is home to nearly 60 000 tree species a third are threatened with extinction mainly from agriculture grazing and exploitation but globally only a tiny fraction of species are widely planted according to tree planting groups and scientists they're planting the same species all over the world said meredith martin an assistant professor of forestry at north carolina state university who found that non profit tree planting efforts in the tropics tend to prioritise the livelihood needs of people over biodiversity or carbon storage over time she said these efforts risk reducing biodiversity in forests non profit tree planting groups often say they plant non native species because local communities ask for them but deeper engagement can yield a different story said susan chomba who oversees forest restoration and conservation in africa for the world resources institute a global research non profit group when given the chance to consider what they want to accomplish on their land farmers will recall for instance that when they had more trees they also had streams she said they want the water back then you say 'in your traditional local knowledge what kind of tree species are suitable for returning water into the ecosystem ' chomba continued they will give you a whole range of indigenous tree species a major hurdle is lack of supply at local seed banks which tend to be dominated by popular commercial species some groups overcome this problem by paying people to collect seeds from nearby forests another solution experts say is to let forests come back on their own if the area is only lightly degraded or sits near existing forest a method

        "content": "the blue green earth is a warm globe travelling through freezing space the thin blanket of the planet's atmosphere makes life possible with the global average temperature around 15 deg c greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o help trap the sun's warmth just like the glass of a greenhouse does over millennia the levels of these gases especially co2 have varied and so have temperatures the difference now is that mankind's activities are adding so much co2 ch4 n2o and several other potent greenhouse gases that things are heating up very quickly much faster than in the past co2 levels are now the highest in 3 5 million years and this rise has occurred in little over a century most of it in the past 50 years average temperatures globally are now 1 2 deg c higher than pre industrial times this means humankind is moving into a world we have never experienced the natural world is also struggling with hotter temperatures hotter oceans droughts and extreme weather events threatening the future of many species the simple answer is rapid population growth and an insatiable demand for resources to fuel economic expansion burning fossil fuels coal oil and gas is mainly to blame but deforestation and agriculture too consumption of fossil fuels coal especially has soared in recent decades though developed nations are responsible for the bulk of accumulated emissions a major source of recent emissions growth has come from big developing nations such as china india and indonesia as shown in the graph below china's emissions are now about double those of the united states the world's second top co2 emitter china is the world's top coal producer and consumer relying on coal for nearly 60 per cent of its energy needs in an effort to curb the growth of coal use and meet rising demand for electricity china is also the world's top renewable energy investor but displacing coal remains a huge challenge rapid expansion of coal fired power stations in china has caused emissions to soar china is now by far the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter producing about 28 per cent of mankind's carbon emissions mostly from coal over the past three decades oil and gas consumption has also risen sharply big developing nations are now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions growth while emissions from the us and european union have been declining as they switch to cleaner sources of energy historically though the us has been most responsible for humanity's share of co2 in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age a recent analysis by carbon brief looked at the nations historically responsible for most of the co2 emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere since 1850 included were emissions from fossil fuels and cement production and from land use change and forestry mainly deforestation carbon brief found that the us china and russia account for nearly 40 per cent of accumulated co2 emissions from human activity brazil and indonesia ranked fourth and fifth are responsible for another 8 6 per cent largely because of decades of deforestation germany comes next in the top 10 list followed by india britain japan and canada deforestation and forest fires are big sources of co2 trees naturally soak up large amounts of co2 from the air for photosynthesis storing the carbon in their trunks roots and the soil chopping them down stops this and rotting and burning timber releases lots of co2 burgeoning demand for food especially grains meat and vegetable oils has led to millions of hectares of forest being cleared to create farmland recent research published in the nature food journal found that the global production of food is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gases from human activity the production of meat as well as livestock feed is responsible for 57 per cent of all food production emissions the research found with 29 per cent coming from the cultivation of plant based foods the risks and causes of climate change have long been known with the united nations creating a special climate science body the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in 1988 more than half of all cumulative global co2 emissions from human activity have taken place since 1990 just as international climate science efforts and climate diplomacy were getting off the ground the chart below from the global carbon atlas shows annual growth in co2 emissions which have grown especially strongly since 2000 in 1990 the ipcc issued its first report on the science and risks of climate change the report underlined the importance of climate change as a challenge with global consequences and requiring international cooperation since then the ipcc's reports issued every five to six years have made progressively stronger conclusions about the threat from climate change and that mankind is unequivocally to blame in its most recent report in august 2021 the ipcc concluded that climate change is widespread rapid and intensifying with some impacts such as sea level rise now irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years as temperatures rise the intensity and severity of events such as heatwaves flooding rains and droughts increases the greater the average global warming the worse things become as shown in the chart below under current conditions with global average temperatures rising 1 deg c since pre industrial times today extreme heat events are already happening 2 8 times more often than they did between 1850 and 1900 if temperatures were to rise to 1 5 deg c the chances of extreme heat events would spike to 4 1 times more often yet despite the warnings the years of scientific evidence and the sharp increase in the severity of extreme weather events many governments have been slow to act emissions have kept rising and temperatures along with them think of climate change as a runaway train only deep and swift emissions cuts acting like powerful brakes will slow the train before the bend ahead the ipcc says warming could hit 1 5 deg c within a decade unless carbon emissions are dramatically cut as the chart below shows global average temperatures have been rising quickly since the 1970s in line with rapid global economic growth and rising fossil fuel consumption beyond the 1 5 deg c temperature threshold is a future with far more intense weather extremes that threaten human health and livelihoods every half a degree rise in temperature matters says the ipcc and a 2 deg c rise would lead to higher crop losses and near total destruction of coral reefs as we know them reefs are already under severe pressure the great barrier reef has lost 50 per cent of its shallow water coral cover in just a few decades yet current climate pledges of all nations are putting the world on a path to warm 2 7 deg c by the end of this century a level that will greatly accelerate sea level rise as ice caps in antarctica and greenland melt faster satellite data shows the greenland and antarctic ice sheets are losing ice six times faster than they were in the 1990s twenty six years of climate diplomacy comes to a head at a major un climate meeting in glasgow from oct 31 to nov 12 called cop26 since the first meeting cop1 in berlin in 1995 nations especially rich nations have been under pressure to cut emissions to limit global warming but progress in the un climate diplomacy arena has been slow and failed to limit rapid growth of emissions in the atmosphere or rising temperatures the overall goal for cop26 is for nations to step up emissions cuts to keep the 1 5 deg c warming limit within sight and to finally achieve us 100 billion s 135 billion in annual climate finance for poorer vulnerable nations several major polluting nations including china and india have yet to announce their new or updated climate pledges as mandated under the 2015 paris climate agreement under the paris pact nearly 200 nations agreed to limit warming to well below 2 deg c and aim for 1 5 deg c if possible getting there means net zero emissions by 2050 cop26 is regarded by the un as the last chance to avoid a climate catastrophe

        "content": "singapore the united nations climate change conference cop26 finally concluded on saturday night nov 13 more than a day after it was scheduled to end the outcome called the glasgow climate pact will provide greater clarity for nations to implement stronger domestic climate policies that will help the world avoid harsher climate impacts the straits times gives an overview of the climate negotiations and the outcomes from cop26 in 2015 almost 200 nations adopted the paris agreement which sets out global aims but not how they can be achieved after three years of negotiations nations agreed in 2018 to adopt the paris rulebook a guide on how the agreement can be implemented at cop24 in poland the rulebook was like an almost complete jigsaw puzzle that was missing a few key pieces the main outline was there but a number of thorny issues needed to be worked out for a global consensus to be reached limit global warming to well below 2 deg c preferably to 1 5 deg c above pre industrial levels this threshold is needed to avoid harsher climate impacts achieve net zero emissions by 2050 take action to adapt to climate change impacts such as building coastal infrastructure to keep out rising seas direct capital towards a low carbon future the cop26 meeting aimed to finalise details of how the paris agreement can be implemented the straits times highlights six key issues that negotiators discussed the six pieces of the jigsaw that will help pave the way for putting the agreement into effect the glasgow meeting was all about limiting warming meaning the world needs to make deeper faster cuts to emissions from burning fossil fuels or deforestation cop26 host britain said a key outcome was to keep 1 5 deg c within reach the only way to achieve this was for nations to beef up their climate pledges called nationally determined contributions ndcs under the paris agreement new climate pledges must be submitted every five years many countries submitted their first round of pledges in 2015 or 2016 this year's conference which was postponed by a year due to the covid 19 pandemic marks the second round of submissions from countries the second round of pledges set out targets to be achieved by the year 2030 countries were expected to collectively pledge much more ambitious emissions reductions but in an analysis of the 2030 targets set out by countries research consortium climate action tracker said the pledges still put the world on a path to warming by 2 4 deg c by the end of the century rapid emissions cuts would require trillions of dollars of investment in renewable energy and slashing reliance on fossil fuels something many countries especially developing nations are unable or reluctant to do the text emphasises the urgent need for all parties to increase efforts to cut emissions highlighting that current pledges are far from what is needed it also asks nations to pursue efforts to limit warming to the 1 5 deg c goal and reiterates that climate impacts would be less severe at this level it requests nations to revisit and strengthen their 2030 targets in their ndcs by the end of 2022 it also calls for a phase down of coal plants that do not capture co2 pollution it notes with serious concern that emissions are on track for a 13 7 per cent increase by 2030 vs the 45 per cent decrease required to limit warming to 1 5 deg c the pact also urges those that have yet to update their ndcs to do so as soon as possible and requests the un climate body to publish annual snapshots of collective ndcs to gauge ambition if the glasgow conference was all about cutting emissions it is money that is going to make this happen poorer nations want wealthier ones to make good on a pledge they made over a decade ago to channel us 100 billion s 135 billion in annual climate finance by 2020 to green their economies and help them adapt to climate impacts developing nations are the least responsible for the decades of planet warming emissions in the atmosphere but they are feeling the impacts most keenly from rising sea levels and more powerful storms that batter their coastlines and wipe out homes and crops to severe droughts and heatwaves climate cash has become an issue of trust that rich nations will do as they say rich nations have dragged their feet on this issue with climate funding hitting only us 79 6 billion in 2019 the us 100 billion pledge still came up short in glasgow it might be reached by next year helped by additional pledges from japan denmark and others during the conference adaptation finance flows will be at least double 2019 levels by 2025 going some way to meet a demand by poorer nations for more adaptation money the final text also calls upon parties to rapidly scale up the deployment of clean power generation and accelerate efforts towards the phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies the issue of finance also extends to the irretrievable loss and damage caused by climate impacts such as loss of life and damage to infrastructure poorer nations are seeking additional finance to cope with the rising and repeated costs of climate change this is a critical issue for the poorest and most vulnerable nations such as small island nations greatly threatened by rising sea levels and storms repeated losses and damage threaten livelihoods and economic development this has been a long running issue as vulnerable nations regard themselves as innocent victims of impacts caused by big polluting nations while a mechanism has been created to help look at the issue developing nations want commitments on new and additional financial resources but there remains knowledge gaps on the scale of loss and damage and the financing and technical assistance needed industrialised nations are also wary of liability risks and compensation claims greater recognition of the need to address loss and damage though no money was committed developing nations have pushed for money from rich nations to pay for loss and damage caused by climate impacts driven by greenhouse emissions but rich countries have resisted fearing large compensation payments the glasgow pact agreed to greater funding support for a technical body called the santiago network which provides technical assistance to help vulnerable nations avert minimise and address loss and damage the final text removed a reference to a financial facility for loss and damage that aimed to channel funds to poorer nations instead parties agreed to establish the glasgow dialogue to discuss funding with the aim of concluding the talks by mid 2024 the outcome of discussions on carbon markets coded under article 6 of the paris agreement was to determine whether countries can trade carbon credits to meet their ndcs it would also establish rules on who emissions savings accrued to if one nation paid to set up a green initiative say a wind farm instead of a coal plant in another country this was the biggest unresolved piece of the paris rulebook and the only one that failed to reach a consensus at cop24 a consensus was also not reached at cop25 carbon markets can enable cost effective emissions reductions in the short term for example it might be cheaper for one country to pay to conserve a forest elsewhere rather than replace its entire fossil fuel based energy grid with one based on renewables carbon credits can also direct public and private capital to green ventures such as clean cookstoves for poor villages or forest conservation projects but an international carbon market that lacks clear rules could increase global emissions if for example both buyers and sellers of carbon credits claim the reductions under their ndcs the problem of double counting where the countries selling the carbon credits count the carbon savings under their own national targets could be tough to overcome the aim was still to achieve a reduction in overall emissions so carbon markets would have to go beyond offsetting but conflict was possible over which carbon credits are to be set aside and not used for any country's ndcs debate was also ongoing over whether credits generated under the kyoto protocol's clean development mechanism which expired in 2020 could be carried over to the paris agreement with opponents saying this could prevent new additional mitigation activities from being developed there will be no double counting of carbon credits this means that the countries selling the carbon credits cannot count the savings under their own national targets or sell the same credit to two different parties parties also agreed to the carrying over of carbon credits generated under the kyoto protocol if these credits had been generated since 2013 countries also agreed that there would be a levy imposed on trades made under article 6 with the funds going to a fund that will help developing countries better prepare for the impacts of climate change this levy is mandatory for trades made under some parts of article 6 but voluntary in others nations agreed at cop24 in 2018 to adopt the enhanced transparency framework by 2024 this framework requires all countries to report among other things their greenhouse gas emissions their progress in achieving their ndcs how they will be impacted by climate change and how they plan to adapt to these impacts the support they have received from others such as financial aid or training and how these were used previously the reporting requirements and the timetable for the submission of national reports were different for developed and developing countries given that developing countries have relatively less developed institutional capacity for transparency reporting their requirements were less onerous than that of developed countries transparency in measurement reporting and verification of emissions will allow observers to monitor progress in limiting global warming some countries have ndc targets that aim to reduce emissions across their entire economy while others focus on emissions reductions from certain sectors such as their energy or forestry sectors it will not be easy to finalise a common reporting format that can accommodate these different types of pledges an enhanced framework will require nations to find common ground over the kinds of technical assistance that will be provided to developing countries to help them meet it some countries had initially argued for the flexibility to delete rows and columns from the reporting table if they could not provide the information but at cop26 all parties agreed that no deletion would be allowed countries must denote fx which represents 'flexibility' in the reporting tables if they are unable to report certain information but they will need to explain their capacity constraints a new training programme for technical experts to help review the biennial transparency reports from 2024 was also agreed currently ndcs have different end dates some countries set five year targets while others set 10 year ones for example singapore's ndc is a 10 year one in its second ndc announced last year singapore said it will aim to have its emissions peak around 2030 countries had agreed at cop24 that post 2030 ndcs should have a common time frame further delays on setting common time frames would mean that countries have less time adjusting their domestic planning and reviewing processes to meet their targets there was also concern that a longer time frame would lock in high emitting infrastructure such as new fossil fuel plants making it more challenging to limit global temperatures in the long term there was likely to be negotiations over the three options on the table whether ndcs should follow a five or 10 year cycle or a 5 5 cycle that would require countries to use a five year time frame with tentative 10 year targets countries generally agreed on a five year cycle which will be submitted five years before they take effect this means that the next round of climate pledges which are due in 2025 will be for the year 2035 pledges made in 2030 will be for 2040 and so on this decision sets out the international norm for subsequent climate pledges but the language of this provision is weak with parties merely encouraged to do this this gives outlier countries such as those who insist on maintaining a 10 year ndc the flexibility to submit their 2040 ndcs in 2025 for instance find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the st microsite here read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the

        "content": "singapore the sun beat down on our sweat stained backs as we toiled away changkul garden hoe in hand digging into the earth to plant our tree saplings the idea of tree planting i previously had in my head involved removing soil from the surface and i took it to be much easier than my current struggles with the sheer weight of the gardening tool it helps to focus on the mechanics of digging how the changkul is held and thrust into the soil how its handle is levered and how the soil is then gently and effortlessly lifted out getting these techniques right makes a world of difference as i learnt the hard way with plans in place to plant one million trees by 2030 to restore singapore s green canopy the heart of the effort will likely have to be community led this is not easy since urbanites often lack a sense of intimacy with their natural environment acknowledging this national university of singapore nus biology lecturer n sivasothi coordinates regular planting sessions with environmental volunteer group nus toddycats at the kranji coastal nature park where participants can get their hands dirty and play a role in reforesting the area the group which has already made 19 visits one of which i joined to the nature park so far will be working there for the long term said mr sivasothi this helps to create a sense of connection with the land and in turn cultivates an appreciation for singapore's natural habitats he added the national parks board nparks started work to restore the coastal beach and back mangal habitats of kranji coastal nature park in august 2020 the back mangal habitat is a step further from the shore where the mangroves reside native species have been selected to restore these habitats and they include critically endangered species as well as species that help to rejuvenate the soil and attract seed dispersers such as birds this can in turn stimulate the growth of other plants from adjacent forests the quality of the soil is affected by its composition and the area's land use history the particular spot where i was digging looked unassuming and dull but turned out to be teeming with life earthworms millipedes and flies this points to the soil being fertile and healthy whereas dry clay like soil means soil enhancements are needed to improve the sapling's odds of survival the tree sapling i planted was the palaquium obovatum a native flowering species which can grow up to 40m in height once the sapling was planted i covered it with soil careful to ensure that its root collar remained visible so the roots could breathe before adding a wooden stake to provide support when it grows then i sprinkled the sapling generously with dead leaves to form a ring around the base this is done to discourage the growth of weeds that can smother the tree and to also help the tree retain moisture around the roots the decomposing leaves also provide nourishment to the growing sapling the volunteer group i joined on feb 12 planted a total of 60 saplings a small step forward to regenerating the area into a lush green forest where creatures such as the white bellied sea eagle can one day nest comfortably to restore a habitat is to give it new life while at the same time acknowledging loss mr sivasothi has fond memories of the kranji coastal nature park where he conducted coastal cleanups for 20 years as an undergrad i worked with professor dennis murphy a veteran zoologist at various mangrove sites mapping and measuring trees the park at the time was state land and there was a lot of trash as all the kampungs had moved out and trash from the johor straits accumulated in the mangrove he said the wonders of the mangrove ecosystem left an imprint on him so did the trash so when ms kate thome who was then the coordinator of international coastal cleanup singapore approached him to conduct cleanups at the mangroves along the kranji coastline he agreed lots of exceptional volunteers from nus and the public joined the effort and it was a healing experience said mr sivasothi in 2014 when nparks took over the park as part of an extension of the sungei buloh wetland reserve the mangroves were healthy and recruiting new saplings but the land area next to it was a wasteland so in 2020 when nparks initiated their coastal reforestation project there i asked for nus toddycats to be part of it he added i saw many green places disappear over the years but here a reserve was declared expanded and eventually extended to include the mandai mangrove and mudflat nature park in 2018 this was healing for my heart said mr sivasothi i ended the day by virtually planting my tree on the map at nparks' trees sg website and made a promise to myself to return soon to monitor my sapling's health and to plant more trees with more than 600 000 trees to be planted by 2030 i hope that more people step forward and help restore these natural habitats of our island home those who

resettled hundreds of farmers and their families all to feed one of the most extensive snow making operations in the history of the games this is what happens when the international olympic committee decides to bring the winter games to a place almost completely lacking in one of the main ingredients for winter sports snow in addition beijing and its nearby mountains did not have that much water to make the artificial kind either machine made snow has played a major role in winter sports for decades even in snowier places like norway switzerland and colorado in beijing's version of the winter games the competitions that began this weekend will for the first time take place almost entirely on artificial snow necessitating an olympic snow making and water management operation of enormous scale and foreshadowing the reality of snow sports everywhere as the planet warms on the mountains where the alpine competitions take place which do not have any recreational skiing narrow strips of white visible from miles away now cut through the brown mountains beijing officials insist that snow production for the games will not strain local water supplies which have struggled to keep pace with the city's demands but china's herculean investments in snow making are part of larger efforts to turn the arid mountains near beijing into a permanent ski and snowboard hub a project that could face challenges as climate change upends patterns of rainfall and drought worldwide the environmentally unfriendly secret of skiing and snowboarding competitions is that as natural snow becomes less reliable they almost always take place on the artificial kind as the planet continues to heat up machine made snow will play an ever larger role in guaranteeing a consistent high calibre field of play you could not have winter sports now without man made snow said mr michael mayr the asia manager of technoalpin the italian company in charge of snow making for the beijing games and at six previous winter olympics what sets beijing apart from many of those past venues are its tight supplies of water whether for snow making or for anything else over the past few decades rapid development has sapped beijing's groundwater july and august often bring heavy rains but the city and nearby mountains get only sprinkles of precipitation in the winter less than 6 35cm per season on average in recent decades according to data from a weather station near the olympic venues in 2017 the last year for which international figures are available beijing had only about as much freshwater resources per resident 164 000 litres as the western african nation of niger at the edge of the sahara zhangjiakou the city 160km north west of the capital that will host some skiing and snowboarding events had 377 000 litres per resident comparable to djibouti in the horn of africa the united states by contrast had 10 5 million litres per person countries with roughly less than one million litres of freshwater resources per person are considered water scarce mr florian hajzeri who has been in china for four years overseeing the snow making project for technoalpin said he realised the magnitude of his task as soon as he saw the landscape of the olympic competition areas there are trees and vegetation but it is not like an alpine forest it is vegetation for a drier climate he said it snows but it is not enough for the competitions before technoalpin could install pumps and build more than 64km of pipe at a cost of nearly us 60 million s 81 million chinese officials first had to figure out how to deliver enough water to the mountains how much water roughly one million cubic m according to technoalpin enough to fill 400 olympic size swimming pools and that is just to start the games more snow and more water will likely be needed as the competitions take place to gather it all the chinese authorities have built pumping stations to carry water from reservoirs miles away according to a state run newspaper beijing has diverted water from the city's baihebao reservoir to the guishui river which flows near the olympic zone but had long been mostly dried up in winter previously baihebao had primarily supplied the miyun reservoir one of the largest stores of clean water for beijing households officials in zhangjiakou have turned off irrigation across thousands of ha to conserve groundwater and resettled farmers who were living in what is now the olympic competition area in high rise apartments modern china is no stranger to monumental water projects its biggest effort to ease beijing's water troubles began well before the olympics a colossal series of waterways that is transferring trillions of litres of water a year from the nation's humid south to its thirsty north hundreds of thousands of villagers were relocated to make way for the canals water from the project accounted for a sixth of beijing's water supply in 2020 while the chinese government has made progress on water issues in recent years scientists and environmentalists say the capital cannot afford to rest on its laurels they still have to do more on water conservation increasing water use efficiency and ensuring social equity in water allocation said professor of water resources engineering ximing cai at the university of illinois urbana champaign if the olympics spur a burst of economic development in the hills near beijing he said the water use associated with that should be planned with caution but climate change could both deepen northern china's need for water and affect southern china's ability to provide it scientists have found that recent severe heat waves and floods in china were much more likely to occur because of human caused climate change under the backdrop

        "content": "singapore when it comes to the impact of climate change nations are on guard for the major ones rising sea levels droughts or floods extreme weather events but a warming world may have more insidious repercussions with a new study led by researchers at the nanyang technological university ntu showing that climate change could also affect the very air we breathe each gulp of air humans take contains more than just life giving oxygen it is also populated with micro organisms such as bacteria and fungi each too small to be seen with the naked eye by studying air samples taken at different heights from ground level and up to 3 500m researchers at ntu's singapore centre for environmental life sciences engineering have shown that as the world warms the composition of micro organisms in the air could change their paper was published on tuesday feb 8 in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america there are already indicators showing that airborne micro organisms can impact human health and agriculture said ntu's professor stephan schuster who supervised the latest work so a changing composition of the air microbiome micro organisms in the air could have implications for human societies he added for example prof schuster's team had found earlier that while healthy people did not suffer ill effects from breathing in micro organisms from the air people with respiratory diseases showed an increased immune response worsening their respiratory symptoms any change in the dynamics of airborne microbial communities could impact respiratory health in an as yet unknown and therefore potentially concerning way prof schuster told the straits times as global temperatures warm heat tolerant micro organisms that thrive in tropical climates could spread to higher latitudes affecting biodiversity and agriculture there this could change disease dynamics for various crop species and potentially also livestock which are not adapted to tropical airborne microbial communities prof schuster added atmospheric micro organisms such as fungi and bacteria usually remain suspended in the air once they are blown off the planet's surface only a fraction of these find their way back down to the surface together with larger particles such as sand grains or dust or when washed down by rain droplets for the latest research which involved more than 30 scientists from ntu as well as their collaborators from institutions in germany and brazil the team took 480 air samples in germany the samples were collected by researchers scaling a 200m meteorological tower and using a research aircraft that circled at different heights from ground level up to 3 500m from the samples the researchers could identify about 10 000 airborne microbial organisms and map out where in the air column they were found they found that the part of the air column from the ground up to about 1 000m where the boundary layer is is rather evenly mixed during the day the boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere closest to the ground and is the part of the air column that is most intimately affected by the ground through interactions with solid earth or water surfaces for instance when the sun beats down on earth the ground warms up faster than the air but the ground re radiates heat causing the air parcel closest to it and the micro organisms it contains to warm and rise up the air column this continues throughout the daylight hours with air parcels closest to the ground constantly being moved up within the boundary layer in turbulent fashion at night however without the heating effect of the sun the air in the boundary layer becomes more stratified or layered with the warmer less dense air parcel sitting atop cooler air parcels closer to the ground said prof schuster this means that airborne microbial organisms remain suspended in the air during night time as their return to the ground is impeded by the denser air masses this effect is also the reason hazy mornings tend to clear up after the sun rises fully when the ground starts to heat up causing air closest to it and the suspended particles they contain to rise the research team found there is a varying air microbiome composition within the boundary layer over the course of a day daytime hours were characterised by larger amounts of bacteria and certain types of fungi while wood rotting fungi thrive at night above the boundary layer however the composition of micro organisms did not change regardless of day or night these stable upper air layers are not affected by daytime circulation patterns in the boundary layer as the day and night temperatures above the boundary layer are the same the researchers think the lack of temperature changes over the course of a day prevents bacteria in the higher layers from returning to the ground at the stable upper levels above the boundary layer the researchers also found the presence of bacteria that can tolerate higher amounts of solar radiation this means these organisms can survive the sun's shortwave radiation unlike more sensitive micro organisms living on the ground these findings say the researchers indicate that temperature would be a key factor in changing the composition of the air microbiome the reason for this lies in the changing height of the boundary layer in a warmer world higher surface temperatures can raise the height of this layer as air near the surface heats up it ascends through the atmosphere pushing the upper boundary higher said prof schuster a higher boundary layer would mean that the part of the air column affected by day night circulation patterns overlaps with the previously stable parts of the atmosphere where a greater abundance of bacteria thrive this could mean that all airborne bacteria and fungi including those that can act as plant pathogens or cause respiratory illnesses in humans and animals could reach densely populated areas of human societies that are currently unaffected how exactly the changing composition of micro organisms in the air could affect human health and ecosystems warrants further research prof schuster said he added that the team hopes to conduct similar studies in other global settings in indoor and outdoor environments to investigate the composition of the air microbiome elsewhere look up there are microbes in the sky he said in reference to the popular netflix satirical film don t look up the movie had through the prism of global reaction towards a fictional comet hurtling towards earth highlighted political and media indifference to climate change changes to the planet's airborne micro organisms driven by climate change could impact

an international team of scientists peel back the layers of how environmental changes can affect wildlife a new study has found that the population growth of three oceanic skater species in the eastern pacific ocean coincided with changes in the climate there the research paper by researchers from the national university of singapore nus and university of california san diego's scripps institution of oceanography was published today sept 6 in scientific journal marine biology their findings show that oceanic skaters can function as a canary in the coal mine in a warming ocean with population trends serving as indicators of how open oceans a challenging habitat to monitor with sensors due to their inaccessibility are changing the study could also help scientists better understand how climate change can impact insects and marine organisms nus marine biologist huang danwei one of the authors of the study said bugs could include parasitic and even disease carrying insects so we might understand whether their populations would overlap substantially with human dominated areas to become a problem for our health oceanic skaters are not easy insects to study their preference for the open ocean means specimens can be obtained only through expensive oceanic expeditions that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a day in 2006 dr lanna cheng sea skater scientist from scripps oceanography learnt that her contacts at the united states' national oceanic and atmospheric administration were planning to go on an oceanic expedition to monitor sea bird whale and dolphin activity in the eastern pacific ocean from california to south america one of the chief scientists on board was interested in flying fish so i said if you are collecting flying fish and shining a light on the surface of the water you must be able to attract my insects too said dr cheng who has been studying these creatures for over five decades and he said 'oh yeah sure no problem' that expedition yielded almost 400 oceanic skater specimens from three species dr cheng who did her bachelor's degree at nus maintained close contacts with scientists at her alma mater in 2017 she sent the skater samples to a laboratory in nus where dr wendy wang was working at that time dr wang was working on a project to see if species could be differentiated just by a fragment of their genome similar to how barcodes can indicate the type of product on sale dr wang found that the barcoding worked but also noticed there were population wide differences in the barcodes of the three different species these genetic variations among the species illustrate different stories of population growth and development during ancient times dr cheng then roped in professor richard norris her colleague at scripps oceanography who specialises in paleoceanography and other nus genomic experts including dr huang and his doctoral student marc chang by matching the genetic data with the fossil record the researchers found that the oldest of the three species halobates splendens went through a population expansion nearly a million years ago this species is now found in the peru current the rich productive waters originating off the coast of south america climatological data showed that this physical feature of cold surface water came into existence a million years ago the two younger species halobates micans and halobates sobrinus now found in the warm relatively unproductive waters off central america increased in abundance 100 000 to 120 000 years ago the populations of both species expanded when el nino climate events caused warm ocean water to move into the eastern pacific ocean el nino events were especially strong in this region about 100 000 years ago which coincides with the time these species developed their modern genetic patterns and population sizes said prof norris the genetics show that the three species we studied each had periods of population growth that fit eerily well with geological evidence for when the current systems they live in came into existence the researchers now plan to study more closely the genetic make up of the oceanic skaters which are hardy creatures exposed to intense sunshine and gusty winds the abilities of their body covering or cuticle to protect their internal organs from heat and ultraviolet damage and to survive violent storms and find food in this unique habitat where no other insect could demonstrate their unique ecological roles in the ocean said dr wang these characteristics make them fascinating subjects of

70 per cent of the combined change in glaciers ice sheet surface mass balance and thermal expansion since 1970 can be attributed to human activity with this percentage increasing over the course of

to 2014 this discovery was made possible only through the use of coral microatolls circular colonies of coral which usually grow sideways from mapur an indonesian island about 100km south east of singapore dr majewski added that the corals there can provide a good gauge of singapore's sea level history over the past century the top surface of the coral microatoll is usually made of dead tissue due to exposure to air while living tissue is found growing along its perimeter forming growth rings similar to the ones found on tree trunks these rings therefore make these coral microatolls natural recorders of sea level change and scientists can trace these changes by counting backwards from the outer age where the living tissue is to determine the age of any part of the coral assistant professor aron meltzner from eos who co led the study noted that tide gauge records from tanjong pagar on singapore's sea levels went back only to 1989 whereas the first data point recorded on the coral microatoll dated back to 1915 between 1915 and 1990 sea level rise in singapore was slower than the global average and sea level was essentially stable however before this study we could only extrapolate the probable sea level in singapore from a global average and the more recent tide gauge records this left quite a bit of uncertainty about how high sea level was and how it changed over the period said prof meltzner dr majewski said the microatolls allowed researchers to narrow down the uncertainty of probable sea levels in singapore by over 40 per cent for earlier periods and about 30 per cent for the more recent period of time likening sea level data to investing in the stock market if one looks only at the past two weeks of historical data and notes that a share had fallen by 10 per cent or 15 per cent one might think that investment would be a terrible idea he added however if you extend the data to maybe a month perhaps you would then see that the stock price had risen and then fallen down and if you extend the time period to 50 years you'll see that the recent period is a tiny tiny little blip in over 30 years of growth said dr majewski the same can be extrapolated to sea levels with current data that stretches only to the 1990s the team is able to see only a small part of the big picture while longer term data provides a fuller picture he added this background will be incorporated into future models allowing experts to be more precise with their predictions of future sea levels and for those in singapore to have a better understanding of how the regional sea level change may differ from the global average he said dr majewski pointed out that the youngest coral microatoll records were cross referenced with tide gauges in tanjong pagar from 1989 thereby validating their potential use in reconstructing sea level change in south east asia as he noted the lack of data for the region as a whole in the latest ipcc report there are a lot of places which didn't have any tide gauges installed until maybe the 1980s or the 1990s or still don't have any tide gauges presently so if they had any corals growing and if we found the right ones we can actually reconstruct the sea level change over the past 100 or 200 years said dr majewski prof meltzner said the team is currently studying the microatolls in the southern islands with plans to conduct similar studies in other sites in indonesia and malaysia these can give more robust data on how sea level rise may have a varied impact on different parts of singapore given how different areas may have had

        "content": "singapore imagine a future where food waste is converted into nutrients for food production all in a work of magic by the ubiquitous black soldier fly this is exactly the vision that an interdisciplinary team of researchers hopes to realise as they develop a blueprint to integrate food waste management and sustainable food production in urban settings like singapore assistant professor nalini puniamoorthy from the national university of singapore's department of biological sciences who is leading the project told the straits times that singapore faces a two fold challenge in its journey to food security as the issue is not only with reducing food waste but also with increasing food production in a sustainable way nearly 700 000 tonnes of food waste is incinerated on a yearly basis while efforts to grow singapore's own local produce are very heavily dependent on imported agricultural inputs such as mineral fertiliser and animal feed that increase the cost of local food production and could have an adverse impact on the environment prof nalini said so we're trying to marry these problems and we think it is feasible by trying to take advantage of what nature already does and that is to use these flies that are nature's very own recyclers she said as larvae black soldier flies are able to consume up to four times their body weight in food waste daily converting the waste into a by product known as frass which can be used to substitute or supplement commercial fertilisers in agriculture the larvae being rich in protein and fats can be used in animal feed formulations for poultry and aquaculture diets the project which prof nalini led with professor stephen cairns from the singapore eth centre's future cities lab global programme is done in collaboration with researchers from the nanyang technological university ntu and eth zurich the three year project is funded by the national research foundation under its campus for research excellence and technological enterprise programme prof cairns said designing fully circular food systems for high density cities like singapore requires experimentation at different scales larger centralised black soldier fly larvae processing facilities could be integrated with food production areas to reduce waste at source and further downstream at hotels and wholesale retailers while compact decentralised facilities could be linked to restaurants hawker centres and urban farms even smaller mobile units might cover more ground in residential areas community farms and construction and harbour sites he added singapore is the first country in asia that is studying the possibility of rolling out black soldier fly facilities on a national scale though such integrated food ecosystems are more established in european suburban and agricultural towns said prof nalini she added that the large scale endeavour will also bring singapore closer to its 30 by 30 goal of increasing the capability and capacity of growing 30 per cent of its food needs locally by 2030 the project which began this month will span five interrelated themes each covered by experts in insect rearing urban design sustainability as well as food safety and nutrition these themes are one of the challenges faced by black soldier flies in an urban environment like singapore would be their reproduction as they need a large space to mate and special conditions to allow for high fertility rates said prof nalini who has a background in evolutionary genomics so what we've been doing is optimising and selecting certain reproductive traits that enable them to mate in small spaces she added the other area of research would be to test the black soldier flies on diverse sources of food waste using machine learning professor alexander mathys from eth zurich's sustainable food processing group told the straits times that this involves using real time sensors to monitor larval behaviour and environmental conditions along with different food waste inputs to determine the most efficient combination said prof cairns recently the idea of producing food in the city is becoming very important as it is a key plank of sustainable future city planning architects often use this term biophilic design which means that we must learn from nature but in my experience architects and designers often only look at the forms and they do so in a way where there's no actual tension between nature and the city in designing an integrated food system however there is a need to consider the more unpleasant aspects of biophilic design such as the smell of food rotting for example how do people interact with the possibility of closing the loop with these facilities which of course is smelly dirty and perhaps has a kind of stigma attached to it said prof cairns this would have a part to play in determining where these black soldier fly facilities are located such as considering whether they are to be situated at the edge of the island near an agricultural zone or completely decentralised and located close to every hawker centre it could also be a combination of all of the above prof cairns added to understand the benefits and costs of introducing black soldier flies to singapore's food management system assistant professor janice lee from the ntu's asian school of the environment will be studying factors such as carbon emissions and energy consumption of using frass or larvae from black soldier flies as an agricultural or aquacultural input for instance this will involve studying whether having a more localised production for these inputs will be able to reduce carbon emission as opposed to importing them to do so data will have to be collected from those conducting agricultural and aquacultural activities and from those who run black soldier fly facilities one big question which many singaporeans will have is whether the quality of local food or produce will change to that end the study will look at whether fish meal used for aquaculture farming such as tilapia and barramundi can be replaced with black soldier fly larvae as the continuous use of fish meal is unsustainable for the environment said assistant professor joyce ong from ntu's asian school of the environment experiments will also be under way to look at the growth rate of the fish as well as their biochemical aspects such as the taste of its flesh she added frass which is left behind from black soldier flies will also be tested as a fertiliser for growing plants such as leafy greens in partnership with plant biologists and urban farms said prof nalini we'll also be monitoring the soil microbial biodiversity and see if there are any benefits because black soldier flies' chitin a fibrous material which functions as a scaffolding material for insects has some anti microbial properties too she noted local food waste streams will also be monitored for their nutritional profile and to look out for any metal contaminants or pathogenic micro organisms to ensure food safety the final but most important part of the project would be to translate the research to both the industry and the community said prof nalini the first such community black soldier fly facility was set up in tampines over a year ago in partnership with environmental consultancy firm otolith enrichment and singapore food agency the team is also working with a few other industrial partners to deal with different types of industrial food waste prof nalini added what i envision in my rose coloured glasses is that even when kids go to school they will know how to separate their food waste after eating in the canteen which will be given to the school garden for growing vegetables and when they go back home they see food waste they're able to tell their parents that they're wasting food education goes hand in hand with application and i think we can effect the change if we're able to show that this entire system will work she added join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now

to have a plan in place to exit the fossil fuel by the end of 2023 coal is contentious for governments across asia as they look to move away from the cheap and widely used but carbon intensive energy source to help meet a global commitment to cut emissions in the fight against climate change under its plan hsbc will cut exposure to thermal coal financing by at least 25 per cent by 2025 and 50 per cent by 2030 although non eu or non oecd based clients could be funded until a global phase out by 2040 its sustainability chief told reuters however groups which had campaigned for hsbc to issue an explicit policy on thermal coal said the bank s plan did not go far enough and still lacked sufficient urgency building on an existing pledge not to finance new coal fired power plants or thermal coal mines hsbc said its policy would help phase out existing coal use in line with the science of climate change and be reviewed annually we need to tackle some of the hard issues head on coal is one of the big issues it contributes 25 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions hsbc group chief sustainability officer celine herweijer said it s not good enough to have a policy on no new coal we need to turn our attention to the urgent phase out of coal alongside the scientific timelines as one of europe s largest banks and with exposure to the industry in emerging markets in asia and elsewhere hsbc has faced pressure from investors and activists to cut funding to those using coal the dirtiest of fossil fuels jeanne martin senior campaign manager at shareaction a group that aims to improve corporate action on environmental social and governance issues said the fact hsbc had introduced a coal phase out policy was in itself a victory for shareholder engagement with banks on climate but more was needed whilst an important step forward the policy lacks the urgency and rigour required to avert the climate crisis she said campaign group reclaim finance which lobbies for a greener financial sector said the plan by hsbc does not put a hard stop to its financing of the coal sector it said the bank provided us 4 1 billion s 5 6 billion to companies planning new coal plants and us 15 billion to the entire coal industry including in energy hungry asia financial institutions who are serious in their net zero commitments should instead blacklist all coal developers without exception it added at the most recent round of global climate talks in scotland last month governments for the first time acknowledged that fossil fuels were the main driver of global warming although coal dependent countries including india and china would only agree to phase down coal fired power while hsbc in common with peers had previously set out a high level commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions across its customer base by 2050 activists had criticised the strength and detail of its policies that prompted some investors to back a planned shareholder vote on the issue at the company s annual meeting this year although they withdrew the threat after the company pledged to release details on coal by the end of this year in a victory for campaigners hsbc said its new policy would apply to all parts of its business including its us 621 billion asset management arm and cover all aspects of financing including refinancing and advisory services the bank said it would next year announce a science based target for coal fired power in line with capping global warming at 1 5 degrees celsius above pre industrial averages with progress on cutting thermal coal financing to be published annually the bank said it would withdraw services from any client that seeks to expand thermal coal production after jan 1 2021 and would no longer finance clients in eu oecd markets for which thermal coal makes up more than 40 per cent of revenues or 30 per cent from 2025 unless the money is explicitly used for clean technology or infrastructure while peers including standard chartered and natwest have set tougher targets hsbc is more exposed to energy clients with a heavy reliance on coal and says it needs to work with them to help them shift to greener energy what will make or break the world s ability to get to this 1 5 degree target is for the energy transition in asia to happen at the speed and scale it needs to happen and we need to be at the heart of influencing that for clients outside the eu and oecd hsbc said it would evaluate their transition plans before deciding whether to offer finance acknowledging the infrastructure policy and resource obstacles many face compared to developed market peers hsbc said it expects clients to publish their own transition plans although campaigners including shareaction have previously said such language would leave hsbc too much wiggle room the spirit of the policy would also cover intermediaries and the parent group of any client that falls outside the policy and hsbc would ask for a commitment that no finance flowed to that entity herweijer said we are not expecting every client to have a credible transition plan in those cases we will have to move away from those relationships herweijer said

        "content": "singapore a digital platform that allows businesses to buy and sell carbon credits was launched on wednesday march 16 by singapore based carbon exchange and marketplace climate impact x cix called project marketplace the platform will allow firms to discover compare and purchase carbon credits from various projects around the world for a start the marketplace will mainly feature carbon credits from nature based solutions such as forest conservation efforts as forests can take in planet warming carbon dioxide co2 from the air through photosynthesis every unit of co2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit there are currently about 10 to 15 such projects listed on the platform including the tambopata bahuaja biodiversity reserve located in the peruvian amazon the agroforestry project which spans an area roughly the size of los angeles entails the restoration of degraded areas there help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production reducing their need to cut down trees in the area cix chief executive mikkel larsen said credits from nature based solutions typically range from us 12 s 16 35 to us 17 per credit he said he expects those listed on project marketplace will be on the higher end although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier mr larsen also said that other types of carbon projects such as those that use technology to suck up co2 from the atmosphere will be listed on project marketplace in the second half of this year the global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity co2 produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions cix which was jointly established last year by dbs bank singapore exchange standard chartered and temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market once the credits purchased are used to offset a firm's emissions the platform can also be used to retire the credits which means a credit is taken off the market never to be traded or swapped again so as to ensure carbon savings are not double counted the launch of the marketplace comes as the government announced last month that large emitters in singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can from 2024 buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions mr larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market especially during periods of uncertainty responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible lasting climate impact our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits said mr larsen to achieve that goal we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data insights and practical guidance to our wider community for example the project marketplace platform will feature third party ratings supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data of the various carbon projects listed on it cix said it works with sylvera a firm that provides data on nature based offset projects sylvera provides information about each project such as the permanence of the carbon removal co benefits of nature based projects and risk global demand for carbon credits is expected to grow following an outcome at last november's climate change conference cop26 that allows countries to buy carbon credits to meet the climate targets they set for themselves under the paris agreement this has made the set up of carbon projects more profitable for land developers who may choose to conserve a forest to sell carbon credits instead of cutting it down for oil palm or other crops but observers have pointed out that such projects need to be established in consultation with indigenous communities living on the land international media outlets have reported on how a controversial carbon trading deal in malaysian borneo was inked with no due diligence or consultation with the indigenous groups living there asked how cix will ensure that credits sold on its project marketplace platform will respect the rights of affected communities mr larsen said social integrity was a key component of cix's assessment of a project before it is listed on the platform he also pointed to cix's independent international advisory council which provides views on the latest science policy and market application the council comprises various experts from academics to non government organisations observers and representatives from global verification bodies we also want to have representation from indigenous communities he said acknowledging that this was a complex issue that varies among countries he said cix was taking steps to assess the various projects in consultation with its advisory council that is ultimately our safeguard of making sure that there is community engagement and that there are no infringement on local communities he said find out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the st

        "content": "moscow afp their economies rocked by conflict russian and ukrainian authorities have deployed different tactics to defend their weakened currencies with varying degrees of success the russian rouble which was trading around 80 to the dollar before moscow sent troops into ukraine on feb 24 lost 40 per cent of its value in the following days slumping to an unprecedented level of 150 to the dollar it has since clawed back much of that trading at around 105 roubles to the dollar seemingly having profited from talks between moscow and kyiv to end the conflict despite having been cut off from much of its foreign currency reserves due to western sanctions the russian central bank has nevertheless occasionally sold some to support the rouble together with strict capital controls that require exporters to sell most of their foreign currency to the central bank and limits on consumers accessing their holdings the measures appear to be working during the past 10 years the central bank intervened directly only several times which now works in favour of the market exchange rate stabilising said analyst alexander kudrin at investment bank aton the first signs of stabilisation are already appearing he added russian economy expert janis kluge at the berlin based swp think tank tweeted recently that the rouble was strengthening thanks to strict capital controls and large oil and gas revenues following the initial sanctions shock in ukraine which is under martial law the central bank has suspended all currency trading and set a fixed exchange rate of approximately 29 hryvnia to the dollar it also banned foreign currency withdrawals and most cross border payments mr volodymyr lepushynskyi director of monetary policy at the ukrainian central bank said officials had a plan already prepared in case of conflict we always hoped that we would not need to implement it but we were ready he told afp thanks to the experience of working in administrative constraints we had a clear understanding of what needs to be done to prevent destabilisation of the financial sector and to establish its effective operation under such circumstances finance minister sergiy marchenko recently said on ukrainian television that the central bank's measures created certain conditions under which there is exchange rate stability today he also noted that ukraine has received support from its international partners including the european union and world bank adding that the international monetary fund has approved a 1 4 billion emergency aid programme for ukraine mr ousmene mandeng a visiting fellow at the london school of economics warned that while the measures may be justified by the extreme circumstances they carry certain risks the suspension of foreign exchange trading is de facto equivalent to a price freeze and if prolonged can lead to a black market for foreign exchange and de facto multiple currency use he told afp a resumption of foreign exchange trading would be desirable to minimise implied distortions mr mandeng added noting that the ukrainian central bank had eased some restrictions and that some interbank foreign exchange market operations appear to be slowly resuming the central bank's mr lepushynskyi said it plans to relax restrictions as soon as it sees room to do so after the liberation of ukraine from russian invaders and the normalisation of the economic situation we will resume the full operation of the foreign exchange market and lift currency restrictions to pre war levels in the shortest possible time he said mr mandeng also noted that ukraine had about us 28 billion s 37 97 billion in foreign currency reserves at the beginning of the month that should offer some comfort for the short term but may eventually need to be replenished he said ukrainians fleeing the country with hryvnia in their pockets are facing the most direct problems due to lack of convertibility of the currency the european commission's executive vice president valdis dombrovskis said recently that the commission was working together with the european central bank to provide some kind of convertibility assistance so that people are able to convert at least certain amounts of their savings in hryvnia into euros join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

home her cows her family orchard all the land and belongings that her family has not seen since 2008 when russian troops forced them from their hometown during that year's russian georgian war i watch the ukraine news i remember 2008 and it makes me cry said ms marghishvili 57 who now lives in a camp for georgians displaced by that 2008 war georgia should be sanctioning russia blockading them boycotting their exports and for ms marghishvili the big mystery is why hasn't the georgian government already done that along russia's borders in post soviet countries such as georgia that remain caught between russian and western influence the russian invasion of ukraine has presented governments with a strategic dilemma apart from belarus none have backed the russian offensive nor have they strongly opposed it fearful of upsetting a dominant neighbour that is a major source of trade and remittances a guarantor of some countries' security and a potential aggressor to others a small mountainous country of 3 7 million people at the south eastern extreme of the european continent georgia is perhaps running the narrowest gauntlet russia invaded parts of georgia 14 years ago and russian troops still protect south ossetia and abkhazia two secessionist statelets that broke away from georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008 that has put russia in de facto control of roughly one fifth of georgian territory including the town in south ossetia where ms marghishvili once lived to the georgian government this precarious dynamic makes it unwise to speak out too strongly against russia lest russia turn on georgia next we live next to a volcano said mr giorgi khelashvili a lawmaker for georgia's ruling party georgian dream the volcano just erupted and it just happens that the lava is currently flowing down the other side of the mountain but this cautious approach has put the georgian government at odds with most of its population creating a far more pointed clash between majority opinion on ukraine and government policy than in most other european countries recent polling suggests nearly 60 per cent of georgians want a stronger stance on ukraine from their elected officials and many have hung ukrainian flags from their apartments and offices in tbilisi georgia's capital tens of thousands of georgians have rallied to support ukraine and to criticise the government's equivocal approach to a brotherly nation we have different lands and different countries but we have the same sky and we have the same enemy said mr dato turashvili a popular georgian novelist and one of many georgians flying a ukrainian flag outside his home the georgian government says 'it's better to be careful russia is dangerous' but that doesn't matter to the kremlin said mr turashvili if they take kyiv they will take tbilisi the government says the criticism is unfair since it has taken some measures that could anger russia days after the invasion began georgia submitted a rushed application for membership in the european union a largely symbolic indication of its pro western orientation since full membership is years away the government sent humanitarian aid to ukraine admitted more than 5 000 ukrainian refugees and voted in favour of a united nations resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine georgia has also admitted more than 30 000 russians since the war started of whom 12 000 have remained there with tbilisi joining istanbul as one of the primary destinations for the new wave of young russian exiles but despite rising anger from georgian society the georgian government has generally avoided condemning russia directly and has refused to impose sanctions on the russian economy the government has clashed with the country's ceremonial president who has taken a stronger position prevented a charter plane of georgian volunteers from flying to ukraine and blocked entry to several russian dissidents supporters of the government stance include the georgian orthodox church one of the country's most powerful civil institutions whose priests have historically criticised the liberal values they associate with the west we remember that russian troops are standing just 50km away said the reverend andrea jaghmaidze a spokesperson for the church referring to the boundary between georgia and south ossetia about 30 miles 48km distant therefore great wisdom should be shown so as not to place extra burden on the country but many georgians feel that it would be not only more dignified to take a more vocal stance but also more strategic by taking an ambiguous stance on ukraine georgia risks signalling to the west that it is uninterested in proper ties with europe and north america and therefore not worth the west's support said mr giorgi gakharia a former prime minister if your standing is not clear and if your standing is not values based then the brits the germans the french the americans will have questions mr gakharia said where does georgia stand in some cases the desire for a stronger stance against the russian state has morphed into anger at the new russian emigres who have found themselves in an intimidating environment citizens of the russian federation reads a flyer recently posted across central tbilisi you are not welcome here some georgian landlords have refused to rent apartments to russian tenants mr alexey voloshinov a 20 year old journalist for rosbalt a russian news organisation listed by the kremlin as a foreign agent said a landlord had refused him tenancy last week because we're russians and the russian soldiers killed her son in the russian georgian war in 2008 mr voloshinov said mr turashvili the novelist empathises with dissidents and journalists such as mr voloshinov his most famous novel flight from the ussr is about a group of georgian dissidents who tried to escape the soviet union in the 1980s but in a sign of the times even mr turashvili is wary of admitting too large a wave of russians like many georgians he worries that a majority have fled for financial reasons rather than any sincere opposition to the kremlin they have the best writers in

jets it is equipping embattled ukrainian troops with lightweight kamikaze attack drones but not at least in an obvious way conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade russia's technological advantage the white house will commit no us or nato planes to the skies above ukraine a move us officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration but it is providing ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying russian aircraft such is the tenuous balance the biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help ukraine lock russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de escalation navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions and sometimes tortured distinctions when it comes to what kinds of assistance washington should provide even as the situation on the ground evolves pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine pleads with congress and president joe biden to do more to help the balancing act informs every aspect of us policy about the war including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the russian economy the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to ukrainian troops the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether as mr biden did this past week to label president vladimir putin of russia as a war criminal cia officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted ukrainian military units according to us officials but as of now mr biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the united states did in afghanistan against the soviet union during the 1980s they have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation in part because nato supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in kyiv ukraine the new war has forced a recalculation on other fronts in one example us officials have floated the idea of turkey's government providing ukraine with the sophisticated s 400 anti aircraft system it is the very system made by russia that us officials punished turkey a nato ally for buying from moscow several years ago now us diplomats see a way to pull turkey away from its dance with russia and give the ukrainians one of the most powerful long range anti aircraft systems in existence in the white house and the pentagon there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows us officials acknowledge that the judgements of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point

generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the house and senate armed services committees mr biden has made clear that he will not accede to zelensky's insistent pleas that nato impose a no fly zone over ukraine clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the united states and its allies in combat with russian forces and a required step for a no fly zone suppressing enemy anti aircraft weaponry would mean attacking russian air defence installations inside russian territory but during the closed door session lawmakers pressed members of the pentagon's joint staff about another flashpoint the administration's decision not to help supply ukraine with the mig 29 fighter jets that poland has offered and that mr zelensky has said his forces desperately need administration officials have said the move would be escalatory and according to people briefed on the exchanges the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push mr putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the united states as a co belligerent in the war intelligence officials have in fact told the administration that the migs could trigger a russian move against nato during the congressional briefing the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a mig 29 to threaten russian soil in contrast to a javelin anti tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield a mig 29 could fly from kyiv to moscow in a matter of minutes the generals said a capability that the kremlin might see as a direct threat the same day the white house put forth another consideration that to be delivered to ukraine the migs would have to take off from an air base in a nato country possibly inviting retaliation on nato territory by the russians some us officials assert that as a matter of international law the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the ukrainian army has made the united states a co belligerent an argument that some legal experts dispute but while mr putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighbouring countries nato allies where the equipment originates that could change us officials said especially if mr putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing it is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for ukraine said ms andrea kendall taylor a former senior intelligence official who specialised in russia and is now at the centre for a new american security they are trying to figure out how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with russia planes with pilots might be off the table but armed drones are not this past week mr biden announced that the united states would ship small switchblade drones to ukraine that could be used to blow up russian armoured vehicles the single use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink and can be controlled to dive bomb tanks or troops self destructing when they explode unlike the large predator and reaper drones used for decades in iraq afghanistan pakistan and other countries the portable drones pose no threat to russian soil still the white house authorised an initial shipment of only 100 of them to ukraine a small batch that could be intended to see how mr putin reacts to their deployment on the ukrainian front lines depending on the response hundreds or thousands more could be on the way the proposal for turkey to supply ukraine with russian made s 400 anti aircraft systems would also test what mr putin is willing to accept from nato and how far a nato ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing ukraine the idea came up when ms wendy sherman the deputy secretary of state visited turkey two weeks ago ms sherman declined to talk about her discussions a different senior us official said the united states knew the proposal would anger mr putin ukraine already uses turkish made drones but turkey is worried that providing the anti aircraft systems could make the country a target of russia's wrath the ukraine war features tank columns and trenches all features of europe's bloody conflicts of the past century thus far there is little evidence that the united states or russia is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace days before the war began there was a flurry of cyberattacks on ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries including one that was found and partly neutralised by microsoft a european satellite system sometimes used by the ukrainian military was also hit knocking out service although it is still unclear whether the russians carried out the attack what has been missing thus far is a large scale russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside ukraine which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes until the invasion began us cyber command had a unit based in kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks it is now operating from a nearby nato country there is fragmentary evidence that the united states and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched but action seems to have been limited inside the biden administration there is a view that mr putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the us financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the united states and its allies unless and until that happens the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation especially given the risks to the us economy and financial system if russia were to target them the water in afghanistan must boil at the right temperature pakistan's then president general mohammad zia ul haq told his intelligence chief as pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their gruelling battle against soviet troops in neighbouring afghanistan in other words hot enough to convince the russians that the country was not worth the struggle but not so hot as to provoke a broader war in the region the weapons that helped turn the tide of that conflict shoulder fired stinger surface to air missiles are now being unloaded from cargo planes in nato countries and delivered to ukrainian troops on the front lines to help keep russia from controlling the skies given russia's bloody history with stinger missiles us officials have been wary of advertising their use in ukraine this month when general mark milley chair of the joint chiefs of staff visited an airfield near ukraine's border where stingers were being unloaded reporters travelling with him were barred from disclosing the whereabouts of the base even after two senior us officials told the house armed services committee during a public hearing that stinger missiles were among the munitions being sent to ukraine spokespeople avoided using the s word from the lecterns at the white house and pentagon until

home her cows her family orchard all the land and belongings that her family has not seen since 2008 when russian troops forced them from their hometown during that year's russian georgian war i watch the ukraine news i remember 2008 and it makes me cry said ms marghishvili 57 who now lives in a camp for georgians displaced by that 2008 war georgia should be sanctioning russia blockading them boycotting their exports and for ms marghishvili the big mystery is why hasn't the georgian government already done that along russia's borders in post soviet countries such as georgia that remain caught between russian and western influence the russian invasion of ukraine has presented governments with a strategic dilemma apart from belarus none have backed the russian offensive nor have they strongly opposed it fearful of upsetting a dominant neighbour that is a major source of trade and remittances a guarantor of some countries' security and a potential aggressor to others a small mountainous country of 3 7 million people at the south eastern extreme of the european continent georgia is perhaps running the narrowest gauntlet russia invaded parts of georgia 14 years ago and russian troops still protect south ossetia and abkhazia two secessionist statelets that broke away from georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008 that has put russia in de facto control of roughly one fifth of georgian territory including the town in south ossetia where ms marghishvili once lived to the georgian government this precarious dynamic makes it unwise to speak out too strongly against russia lest russia turn on georgia next we live next to a volcano said mr giorgi khelashvili a lawmaker for georgia's ruling party georgian dream the volcano just erupted and it just happens that the lava is currently flowing down the other side of the mountain but this cautious approach has put the georgian government at odds with most of its population creating a far more pointed clash between majority opinion on ukraine and government policy than in most other european countries recent polling suggests nearly 60 per cent of georgians want a stronger stance on ukraine from their elected officials and many have hung ukrainian flags from their apartments and offices in tbilisi georgia's capital tens of thousands of georgians have rallied to support ukraine and to criticise the government's equivocal approach to a brotherly nation we have different lands and different countries but we have the same sky and we have the same enemy said mr dato turashvili a popular georgian novelist and one of many georgians flying a ukrainian flag outside his home the georgian government says 'it's better to be careful russia is dangerous' but that doesn't matter to the kremlin said mr turashvili if they take kyiv they will take tbilisi the government says the criticism is unfair since it has taken some measures that could anger russia days after the invasion began georgia submitted a rushed application for membership in the european union a largely symbolic indication of its pro western orientation since full membership is years away the government sent humanitarian aid to ukraine admitted more than 5 000 ukrainian refugees and voted in favour of a united nations resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine georgia has also admitted more than 30 000 russians since the war started of whom 12 000 have remained there with tbilisi joining istanbul as one of the primary destinations for the new wave of young russian exiles but despite rising anger from georgian society the georgian government has generally avoided condemning russia directly and has refused to impose sanctions on the russian economy the government has clashed with the country's ceremonial president who has taken a stronger position prevented a charter plane of georgian volunteers from flying to ukraine and blocked entry to several russian dissidents supporters of the government stance include the georgian orthodox church one of the country's most powerful civil institutions whose priests have historically criticised the liberal values they associate with the west we remember that russian troops are standing just 50km away said the reverend andrea jaghmaidze a spokesperson for the church referring to the boundary between georgia and south ossetia about 30 miles 48km distant therefore great wisdom should be shown so as not to place extra burden on the country but many georgians feel that it would be not only more dignified to take a more vocal stance but also more strategic by taking an ambiguous stance on ukraine georgia risks signalling to the west that it is uninterested in proper ties with europe and north america and therefore not worth the west's support said mr giorgi gakharia a former prime minister if your standing is not clear and if your standing is not values based then the brits the germans the french the americans will have questions mr gakharia said where does georgia stand in some cases the desire for a stronger stance against the russian state has morphed into anger at the new russian emigres who have found themselves in an intimidating environment citizens of the russian federation reads a flyer recently posted across central tbilisi you are not welcome here some georgian landlords have refused to rent apartments to russian tenants mr alexey voloshinov a 20 year old journalist for rosbalt a russian news organisation listed by the kremlin as a foreign agent said a landlord had refused him tenancy last week because

voloshinov his most famous novel flight from the ussr is about a group of georgian dissidents who tried to escape the soviet union in the 1980s but in a sign of the times even mr turashvili is wary of

government in kyiv ukraine the new war has forced a recalculation on other fronts in one example us officials have floated the idea of turkey's government providing ukraine with the sophisticated s 400 anti aircraft system it is the very system made by russia that us officials punished turkey a nato ally for buying from moscow several years ago now us diplomats see a way to pull turkey away from its dance with russia and give the ukrainians one of the most powerful long range anti aircraft systems in existence in the white house and the pentagon there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows us officials acknowledge that the judgements of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point and that all that really matters is the judgement of one person mr putin on wednesday march 16 the task of articulating the intricacies of the us' military policy toward ukraine fell to a group of generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the house and senate armed services committees mr biden has made clear that he will not accede to zelensky's insistent pleas that nato impose a no fly zone over ukraine clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the united states and its allies in combat with russian forces and a required step for a no fly zone suppressing enemy anti aircraft weaponry would mean attacking russian air defence installations inside russian territory but during the closed door session lawmakers pressed members of the pentagon's joint staff about another flashpoint the administration's decision not to help supply ukraine with the mig 29 fighter jets that poland has offered and that mr zelensky has said his forces desperately need administration officials have said the move would be escalatory and according to people briefed on the exchanges the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push mr putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the united states as a co belligerent in the war intelligence officials have in fact told the administration that the migs could trigger a russian move against nato during the congressional briefing the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a mig 29 to threaten russian soil in contrast to a javelin anti tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield a mig 29 could fly from kyiv to moscow in a matter of minutes the generals said a capability that the kremlin might see as a direct threat the same day the white house put forth another consideration that to be delivered to ukraine the migs would have to take off from an air base in a nato country possibly inviting retaliation on nato territory by the russians some us officials assert that as a matter of international law the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the ukrainian army has made the united states a co belligerent an argument that some legal experts dispute but while mr putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighbouring countries nato allies where the equipment originates that could change us officials said especially if mr putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing it is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for ukraine said ms andrea kendall taylor a former senior intelligence official who specialised in russia and is now at the centre for a new american security they are trying to figure out how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with russia planes with pilots might be off the table but armed drones are not this past week mr biden announced that the united states would ship small switchblade drones to ukraine that could be used to blow up russian armoured vehicles the single use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink and can be controlled to dive bomb tanks or troops self destructing when they explode unlike the large predator and reaper drones used for decades in iraq afghanistan pakistan and other countries the portable drones pose no threat to russian soil still the white house authorised an initial shipment of only 100 of them to ukraine a small batch that could be intended to see how mr putin reacts to their deployment on the ukrainian front lines depending on the response hundreds or thousands more could be on the way the proposal for turkey to supply ukraine with russian made s 400 anti aircraft systems would also test what mr putin is willing to accept from nato and how far a nato ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing ukraine the idea came up when ms wendy sherman the deputy secretary of state visited turkey two weeks ago ms sherman declined to talk about her discussions a different senior us official said the united states knew the proposal would anger mr putin ukraine already uses turkish made drones but turkey is worried that providing the anti aircraft systems could make the country a target of russia's wrath the ukraine war features tank columns and trenches all features of europe's bloody conflicts of the past century thus far there is little evidence that the united states or russia is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace days before the war began there was a flurry of cyberattacks on ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries including one that was found and partly neutralised by microsoft a european satellite system sometimes used by the ukrainian military was also hit knocking out service although it is still unclear whether the russians carried out the attack what has been missing thus far is a large scale russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside ukraine which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes until the invasion began us cyber command had a unit based in kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks it is now operating from a nearby nato country there is fragmentary evidence that the united states and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched but action seems to have been limited inside the biden administration there is a view that mr putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the us financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the united states and its allies unless and until that happens the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation especially given the risks to the us economy and financial system if russia were to target them the water in afghanistan must boil at the right temperature pakistan's then president general mohammad zia ul haq told his intelligence chief as pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their gruelling battle against soviet troops in neighbouring afghanistan in other words hot enough to convince the russians that the country was not worth the struggle but not so hot as to provoke a broader war in the region the weapons that helped turn the tide of that conflict shoulder fired stinger surface to air missiles are now being unloaded from cargo planes in nato countries and delivered to ukrainian troops on the front lines to help keep russia from controlling the skies given russia's bloody history with stinger missiles us officials have been wary of advertising their use in ukraine this month when general mark milley chair of the joint chiefs of staff visited an airfield near ukraine's border where stingers were being unloaded reporters travelling with him were barred from disclosing the whereabouts of the base even after two senior us officials told the house armed services committee during a public hearing that stinger missiles were among the munitions being sent to ukraine spokespeople avoided using the s word from the lecterns at the white house and pentagon until

security they are trying to figure out how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with russia planes with pilots might be off the table but armed drones are not this past week mr biden announced that the united states would ship small switchblade drones to ukraine that could be used to blow up russian armoured vehicles the single use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink and can be controlled to dive bomb tanks or troops self destructing when they explode unlike the large predator and reaper drones used for decades in iraq afghanistan pakistan and other countries the portable drones pose no threat to russian soil still the white house authorised an initial shipment of only 100 of them to ukraine a small batch that could be intended to see how mr putin reacts to their deployment on the ukrainian front lines depending on the response hundreds or thousands more could be on the way the proposal for turkey to supply ukraine with russian made s 400 anti aircraft systems would also test what mr putin is willing to accept from nato and how far a nato ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing ukraine the idea came up when ms wendy sherman the deputy secretary of state visited turkey two weeks ago ms sherman declined to talk about her discussions a different senior us official said the united states knew the proposal would anger mr putin ukraine already uses turkish made drones but turkey is worried that providing the anti aircraft systems could make the country a target of russia's wrath the ukraine war features tank columns and trenches all features of europe's bloody conflicts of the past century thus far there is little evidence that the united states or russia is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace days before the war began there was a flurry of cyberattacks on ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries including one that was found and partly neutralised by microsoft a european satellite system sometimes used by the ukrainian military was also hit knocking out service although it is still unclear whether the russians carried out the attack what has been missing thus far is a large scale russian cyberattack that disables the power grid or communications systems inside ukraine which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes until the invasion began us cyber command had a unit based in kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks it is now operating from a nearby nato country there is fragmentary evidence that the united states and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched but action seems to have been limited inside the biden administration there is a view that mr putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the us financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the united states and its allies unless and until that happens the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation especially given the risks to the us economy and financial system if russia were to target them the water in afghanistan must boil at the right temperature pakistan's then president general mohammad zia ul haq told his intelligence chief as pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their gruelling battle against soviet troops in neighbouring afghanistan in other words hot enough to convince the

countries embraced an idealistic mission to form cultural and political bonds as sister cities now with russia's invasion of ukraine in its fourth bloody week those ties appear to be fraying as never before across the united states governments in cities including chicago dallas and des moines iowa have moved to suspend decades long relationships with russian sister cities as a statement of condemnation of russia's attack the invasion is perhaps the greatest challenge between our two countries in more than a half century mayor franklin cownie of des moines wrote in a letter to the head of administration of the russian city of stavropol last week after the city council unanimously decided to suspend the sister city relationship this is an act of unprecedented aggression that we as two longtime friends cannot ignore or disregard he wrote plans in iowa to send a delegation to stavropol to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the relationship in july have been called off while many sister city partnerships are largely symbolic the decisions to end or suspend them points to a broader unravelling of ties between the united states and russia in which even relationships between private citizens are becoming strained the collapse of these ties comes as many companies and organisations are halting operations in russia major multinational corporations like mcdonald's and starbucks have temporarily closed locations across the country international sports leagues have barred russian teams from events an international oncology network announced that it would pull out of

relationships between us and russian cities according to sister cities international a citizen diplomacy nonprofit in some cities the relationships have existed largely on paper with leaders exchanging intermittent letters of support in others the partnerships have been more substantive with city leaders making regular visits and students business leaders and doctors participating in exchange programs some sister city partnerships are standing firm in a march 7 letter to the mayor of tallahassee florida mayor lauren poe of gainesville florida emphasised his commitment to maintaining a sister city relationship with the city of novorossiysk in russia and urged the city of tallahassee in the strongest terms possible to do the same with its sister city of krasnodar we must not hold the families of our sister cities responsible for the actions of a nationalist tyrant poe wrote rather we need to strengthen our resolve to build on person to person leadership and celebrate citizen diplomacy the city council of tallahassee voted unanimously two days later to sever its ties with krasnodar gainesville's ties to novorossiysk date to 1982 when gainesville became among the first cities to launch a sister city relationship with a city in the soviet union nearly every gainesville mayor since then has visited at least once during the leader's term i kind of liken it to getting married said steve kalishman executive director for the sister city program of gainesville of the commitment made by the two cities and he would know he met his wife in novorossiysk in 1976 while working on a commercial ship transporting grain to the soviet union after getting married and moving to gainesville the couple pushed the city to pass a resolution making novorossiysk its sister city the two hand delivered the resolution to the city government in novorossiysk along with a symbolic large golden skeleton key in a letter to its members in late february sister cities international pleaded with city leaders to maintain ties to their russian counterparts while suspending or ending a sister city relationship to register disapproval of a foreign government's actions

for the conflict and over beijing's role in pressuring moscow to halt its invasion china's president xi jinping told his us counterpart joe biden that all sides need to jointly support russia and ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace according to a chinese foreign ministry statement released after the two hour video call mr xi added that china had put forward a six point initiative on the humanitarian situation in ukraine and was ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to ukraine and other affected countries mr biden detailed the efforts of america and its allies to prevent and then respond to russia's unprovoked invasion of ukraine including by imposing costs on russia the white house said in a statement it added that mr biden described the implications and consequences if china provides material support to russia as it conducts brutal attacks against ukrainian cities and civilians beijing has denied reports that it was willing to provide moscow with military or economic aid a senior administration official who spoke to reporters after the call declined to specify exactly what sort of penalties the us would impose on china if it armed moscow or helped it circumvent international sanctions the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity also did not say how mr xi responded to mr biden but beijing which is wary of getting hit by russia related sanctions criticised international sanctions as a solution highlighting their impact on global stability and the livelihoods of billions sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer if further escalated they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade finance energy food and industrial and supply chains crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses said the chinese statement analysts noted that beijing continued to refuse to condemn russia for its invasion as it balances between presenting itself as a responsible superpower while staying aligned with moscow instead beijing alluded to what moscow has called legitimate security concerns over nato expansionism near its borders which russian president vladimir putin cited as a reason for his military campaign against ukraine the us and nato should also have dialogue with russia to address the crux of the ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both russia and ukraine said the chinese statement adding that an enduring solution would be for major countries to respect each other and reject a cold war mentality still beijing did put some distance between itself and moscow calling for an end to hostilities as soon as possible china stands for peace and opposes war said its statement overall xi's remarks suggest a reduced tail risk of full chinese support for russia and the retaliation this would trigger from washington said eurasia group analysts in a note after the call they added that the potential for us china cooperation on a diplomatic resolution of the crisis was slim while mr xi called for the us and nato to open a dialogue with russia the idea of such a dialogue is a non

principles such as on sovereignty and territorial integrity mr biden and mr xi who last spoke in november also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication to manage the competition between our two countries said the white house the issue of taiwan which china regards as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland was also discussed mr biden reiterated that us policy on taiwan has not changed and emphasised that the united states continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo said the white house a point which the chinese foreign ministry also highlighted in its statement said ms sun the chinese statement reads almost positively that the us restated its one china policy and committed to not seeking a new cold war with china that's what the chinese wanted to hear overall whether mr biden succeeded in convincing mr xi to press mr putin to end his invasion remains to be seen said analysts us officials are deeply frustrated with china's

home her cows her family orchard all the land and belongings that her family has not seen since 2008 when russian troops forced them from their hometown during that year's russian georgian war i watch the ukraine news i remember 2008 and it makes me cry said ms marghishvili 57 who now lives in a camp for georgians displaced by that 2008 war georgia should be sanctioning russia blockading them boycotting their exports and for ms marghishvili the big mystery is why hasn't the georgian government already done that along russia's borders in post soviet countries such as georgia that remain caught between russian and western influence the russian invasion of ukraine has presented governments with a strategic dilemma apart from belarus none have backed the russian offensive nor have they strongly opposed it fearful of upsetting a dominant neighbour that is a major source of trade and remittances a guarantor of some countries' security and a potential aggressor to others a small mountainous country of 3 7 million people at the south eastern extreme of the european continent georgia is perhaps running the narrowest gauntlet russia invaded parts of georgia 14 years ago and russian troops still protect south ossetia and abkhazia two secessionist statelets that broke away from georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008 that has put russia in de facto control of roughly one fifth of georgian territory including the town in south ossetia where ms marghishvili once lived to the georgian government this precarious dynamic makes it unwise to speak out too strongly against russia lest russia turn on georgia next we live next to a volcano said mr giorgi khelashvili a lawmaker for georgia's ruling party georgian dream the volcano just erupted and it just happens that the lava is currently flowing down the other side of the mountain but this cautious approach has put the georgian government at odds with most of its population creating a far more pointed clash between majority opinion on ukraine and government policy than in most other european countries recent polling suggests nearly 60 per cent of georgians want a stronger stance on ukraine from their elected officials and many have hung ukrainian flags from their apartments and offices in tbilisi georgia's capital tens of thousands of georgians have rallied to support ukraine and to criticise the government's equivocal approach to a brotherly nation we have different lands and different countries but we have the same sky and we have the same enemy said mr dato turashvili a popular georgian novelist and one of many georgians flying a ukrainian flag outside his home the georgian government says 'it's better to be careful russia is dangerous' but that doesn't matter to the kremlin said mr turashvili if they take kyiv they will take tbilisi the government says the criticism is unfair since it has taken some measures that could anger russia days after the invasion began georgia submitted a rushed application for membership in the european union a largely symbolic indication of its pro western orientation since full membership is years away the government sent humanitarian aid to ukraine admitted more than 5 000 ukrainian refugees and voted in favour of a united nations resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine georgia has also admitted more than 30 000 russians since the war started of whom 12 000 have remained there with tbilisi joining istanbul as one of the primary destinations for the new wave of young russian exiles but despite rising anger from georgian society the georgian government has generally avoided condemning russia directly and has refused to impose sanctions on the russian economy the government has clashed with the country's ceremonial president who has taken a stronger position prevented a charter plane of georgian volunteers from flying to ukraine and blocked entry to several russian dissidents supporters of the government stance include the georgian orthodox church one of the country's most powerful civil institutions whose priests have historically criticised the liberal values they associate with the west we remember that russian troops are standing just 50km away said the reverend andrea jaghmaidze a spokesperson for the church referring to the boundary between georgia and south ossetia about 30 miles 48km distant therefore great wisdom should be shown so as not to place extra burden on the country but many georgians feel that it would be not only more dignified to take a more vocal stance but also more strategic by taking an ambiguous stance on ukraine georgia risks signalling to the west that it is uninterested in proper ties with europe and north america and therefore not worth the west's support said mr giorgi gakharia a former prime minister if your standing is not clear and if your standing is not values based then the brits the germans the french the americans will have questions mr gakharia said where does georgia stand in some cases the desire for a stronger stance against the russian state has morphed into anger at the new russian emigres who have found themselves in an intimidating environment citizens of the russian federation reads a flyer recently posted across central tbilisi you are not welcome here some georgian landlords have refused to rent apartments to russian tenants mr alexey voloshinov a 20 year old journalist for rosbalt a russian news organisation listed by the kremlin as a foreign agent said a landlord had refused him tenancy last week because we're russians and the russian soldiers killed her son in the russian georgian war in 2008 mr voloshinov said mr turashvili the novelist empathises with dissidents and journalists such as mr voloshinov his most famous novel flight from the ussr is about a group of georgian dissidents who tried to escape the soviet union in the 1980s but in a sign of the times even mr turashvili is wary of admitting too large a wave of russians like many georgians he worries that a majority have fled for financial reasons rather than any sincere opposition to the kremlin they have the best writers in

        "content": "singapore with the vaccinated travel lane vtl agreements paving the way for two way quarantine free travel stir crazy singaporeans are dusting off their passports and making up for lost time but travel during a global pandemic is fraught with uncertainty and if travel insurance was a good idea pre covid 19 it is practically essential now in fact it is literally essential for certain vtl countries such as malaysia and south korea which require foreigners to purchase travel insurance with covid 19 medical expense coverage as a condition of entry fortunately the majority of travel insurers now provide covid 19 coverage either integrated into the main policy or as an add on rider it is not going to burn a hole in your pocket either with the various ongoing promotions coverage can be had for less than 10 a day see chart on sample coverage of covid 19 travel insurance policies assuming you are vaccinated and in good health any covid 19 infection should be fairly mild however it is still important to have coverage for covid 19 medical expenses whether it is as simple as an outpatient consultation with a doctor or as serious as admission to hospital moreover some vtl countries require foreigners to buy travel insurance with a specified minimum coverage for covid 19 medical treatment you will usually need to present your insurance certificate before boarding the flight in the event that you contract covid 19 and your situation deteriorates doctors may decide that evacuation to singapore for further treatment is necessary this can be a very expensive process according to examples from insurance company chubb medical evacuation via air ambulance can cost upwards of us 100 000 s 136 700 you will want to ensure your travel policy has adequate coverage in this area when choosing your policy make sure it provides separate coverage for medical expenses and emergency medical evacuation for example msig traveleasy standard provides 65 000 of combined coverage for overseas medical expenses and emergency medical evacuation allianz travel insurance bronze provides 1 million of coverage for medical expenses and a separate 1 million of coverage for emergency medical evacuation if your situation is serious enough to warrant repatriation to singapore you may well have incurred significant overseas medical expenses already so it is vital you have something left over to cover the evacuation if you receive a positive covid 19 result while overseas and are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic the standard procedure in most vtl countries is to self isolate in a hotel the two situations where travellers are most likely to receive a positive covid 19 result while overseas are getting a positive result on arrival is not a great way to start your vacation but is unlikely to incur much incremental accommodation costs because you can use the hotel already booked for isolation however getting a positive result on your pre departure test could be expensive because you need to book additional accommodation beyond your originally envisioned return date as you wait for the all clear a quarantine allowance helps defray some of the additional expenses involved while most policies offer 50 a day you are strongly advised to top up a little extra for a policy with 100 a day to cover the cost of a decent hotel also check how many days of quarantine are covered some policies offer seven days others 14 days note that quarantine allowances do not cover situations where quarantine is a published requirement for travel for example singapore residents travelling to indonesia must undergo a 10 day quarantine on arrival no claims will be allowed in this respect travel insurance is meant to cover the possibilities not the certainties there is one thing the quarantine allowance will not cover the immigration checkpoints authority has a policy that says travellers who have been diagnosed with covid 19 in the last 14 days should not travel to singapore suppose your pre departure test in germany is positive and you are issued a seven day self isolation order after seven days you clear a covid 19 pcr test and are released you can claim a quarantine allowance for the seven day period indicated on the self isolation order but not the additional seven days you need to wait in germany before returning to singapore many vtl countries require a pre departure test before leaving singapore should your result come back positive you will almost certainly need to cancel your trip trip cancellation protection offers reimbursement for forfeiture of deposits or charges that are unrecoverable for example flights hotels and tickets to attractions the emphasis is on the word unrecoverable you will usually be required to submit proof that you contacted the merchant to request a refund and were denied if the merchant agrees to refund you a portion of your costs that portion is not recoverable from your travel insurer but trip cancellation does not cover situations where you get spooked out of travelling because of quarantine requirements or travel advisories certain travel insurance policies may also provide coverage for trip postponement which as the name suggests covers the costs incurred in postponing your trip as opposed to cancelling it with the exception of trip cancellation or postponement travel insurance is generally meant to cover you for things that happen outside of singapore in other words if you require overseas medical treatment for a covid 19 infection diagnosed in britain you can file a claim with your travel insurer but if you are diagnosed with covid 19 after returning to singapore from britain you need to file a claim with your regular health insurance provider for medical treatment received in singapore while the singapore government is currently picking up the tab for covid 19 medical bills for fully vaccinated singaporeans permanent residents and long term pass holders an exception applies to those who test positive for covid 19 within 14 days of their arrival in singapore however these individuals will still be able to tap government subsidies and insurance coverage where applicable according to the ministry of health the median acute hospital bill for patients who end up in the intensive care unit and require covid 19 therapeutics is 25 000 although means tested government subsidies and medishield life coverage can reduce the bill to about 2 000 to 4 000 for eligible singaporeans in subsidised wards while travel insurance policies may offer very generous coverage of overseas medical expenses covid 19 treatment is usually a much smaller amount for example axa smarttraveller offers up to 600 000 of overseas medical expenses but only up to 150 000 for those specifically related to covid 19 i can only surmise that it is because covid 19 is a relatively novel disease and underwriters prefer to err on the side of caution by limiting their liability if there is one thing the omicron variant has done it is remind people that border restrictions and quarantine requirements are liable to change at short notice in recent weeks for example sydney and melbourne have imposed 72 hour quarantine for all international arrivals and india reinstated seven day home quarantine for travellers from singapore while both these measures have since been lifted they are reminders of how fast things can change as inconvenient as these things may be changing regulations government advisories against travel and border closures are generally not grounds to claim trip cancellation most policies will cover only trip cancellation if you a travelling companion or family member test positive for covid 19 prior to departure to put it another way while it is unfortunate you need to spend precious overseas time in quarantine that is not really the insurer's concern if you want a policy that covers such situations you might want to consider aviva's travel insurance and its cancel for any reason clause this covers 50 per cent of your unrecoverable travel and entertainment costs capped at 5 000 should you decide not to travel claimable a maximum of once per period of insurance that is annual policy holders can use it only once travel insurance policies have different tiers and coverage the chart illustrative pricing for travel insurance policies uses a seven day trip to south korea as the basis for comparison my advice would be to look for an insurer that provides coverage for all four areas discussed previously some policies do not provide quarantine allowance generally there is no harm in purchasing travel insurance well in advance of your trip since you are charged only for the days overseas for example an insurance company charges the same for a seven day trip to south korea whether you buy it the day before departure or a month in advance but buying it earlier means you will be covered for specified events that occur in the pre departure period such as a positive covid 19 diagnosis should you eventually decide not to travel most singapore based insurers allow you to cancel and refund your policy provided no claims have been made some may charge an administrative fee instead of purchasing travel insurance from a bank or underwriter directly passengers flying on certain airlines can purchase or enjoy complimentary travel insurance with covid 19 coverage for example passengers flying with singapore airlines can purchase a policy underwritten by allianz which provides up to 1 million of overseas covid 19 medical expense coverage and trip interruption coverage of up to 150 a day that would cover additional costs incurred due to quarantine likewise those flying with scoot can buy a policy underwritten by axa with 10 000 of overseas covid 19 medical expense coverage and a daily quarantine allowance of 100 but do note that the relatively low medical coverage will make this unsuitable for certain vtl countries such as malaysia or thailand passengers flying on cathay pacific emirates and etihad will also enjoy complimentary covid 19 medical insurance with no action needed from them travellers can also consider purchasing insurance from overseas companies such as safetywing and world nomads these policies provide coverage for singapore residents and may be more cost effective in certain scenarios however it is important to read up on both the seller and underwriter since you will not have access to mediation bodies like fidrec in the event of a dispute remember that travel insurance provides no coverage should your trip be impacted by new quarantine requirements and even border closures likewise there is no coverage against a disinclination to travel so if you are still on the fence it is a good idea to hold your fire on any non refundable bookings venturing overseas without travel insurance was always a foolhardy endeavour prior to covid 19 and to do so now is borderline insanity do not pinch pennies when it comes to protection no one ever enjoyed a mai tai on the beach while looking over his or her shoulder join st's telegram channel here and get

275 s 375 a night hoi an ancient town located 2km from red bridge is accessible by a five minute taxi ride or a 20 minute boat ride along the thu bon river the best time to visit hoi an is between february and may when the weather is mild with moderate temperatures low humidity and rainfall we visited in june when the temperature rose to a searing 37 deg c avoid the rainy season from september to january but as i spend time in the colourful municipality where travel agents tailors shops eateries and inns occupy every turn i realise the deal today is not inconsistent with hoi an's heritage of attracting travellers between the 16th and 19th centuries hoi an then known as fai fo was a magnet for south east asian trade attracting chinese japanese and european merchants who sailed from the south china sea to the thu bon river to trade porcelain silk spices precious metals and oils the confluence of cultures stamped itself on the town merging local traditions with the architecture of the foreigners who stayed i pause at the house of tan ky 101 nguyen thai hoc street built 200 years ago by an ethnically vietnamese family well conserved and lived in by seven generations of descendants a guide describes the japanese crab shelled ceiling and peaked roof fine chinese poetry and oriental carvings on roof beams and vietnamese crosshatch top support look at those grape leaves she says of the european motif that has embellished the timber balcony over the years as the thu bon river estuary silted up in the 19th century traders stopped coming in droves the town was severed from outside influences for decades and the town architecture was largely untouched by the impact of modernisation just as cao lau is an apt metaphor for hoi an's cultural heritage the ancient town is today a living museum displaying the intriguing convergence of cultures hordes of tourists are crowding the pink hued japanese covered bridge or lai vien kieu arguably the most iconic attraction in hoi an flanking one end are twin sculptures of dogs and monkeys both sacred symbols in ancient japanese culture we are told tailoring is now the lifeblood of hoi an a logical evolution of what was once a major silk trading post i pop into several tailor shops amid the mind boggling 400 in town and attempt to settle on a good tailor with preferred fabrics and skill sets come a woman gestures at me surreptitiously after i express interest to customise a dress behind the curtain she points to a large basket of white wiggly silk worms feeding on mulberry leaves soon these worms spin cocoons and make silk real silk she adds culinary gems we focus on another of hoi an's well known facets its cuisine and begin by exploring the markets at the ancient town faces under conical hats peer out at me and gnarled fingers signal towards vast baskets of tropical fruit on display i feast on magenta dragonfruits butter yellow mangos emerald hued calamansis and ripe custard apples all brilliantly sweet and refreshingly juicy in hoi an we eat fresh from the land a local tells me and i consider how the overused farm to table catchphrase is actually tenable here rice flour is milled from scratch at the nearby paddy fields and fruit and produce are always local and fresh local ingredients are undoubtedly crisp but as with cao lau and many elements of this town offshore influences are highly apparent in its famous dishes in hoi an situated midway between hanoi and ho chi minh city oriental flavours of the north intersect with cambodian influences of the south tinged with a french colonial touch at a restaurant i sample banh bao vac or steamed white rose dumplings tiny balls of shrimp minced pork mushrooms onions and bean sprouts wrapped into a ruffled scallop of rice flour dough then steamed and topped with deep fried shallots and dipping sauce they are thinner and lighter than the traditional chinese dumplings i am familiar with the century old recipe is held secret by a single chinese family at 533 hai ba trung street which painstakingly hand makes 6 000 dumplings a day and dispatches them to eateries all over town nearby people are squatting on stools by the roadside to enjoy xi ma or black sesame paste another closely guarded recipe held by the family of centenarian ngo thieu its creator and living local legend my family returns to our villa for a quiet dinner where we grow to love stir fried morning glory a type of water spinach not the flower a ubiquitous local green that is sauteed with garlic we are enthralled by the in house herb garden a plot of growing greens that will soon adorn dinner platters lemon basil cinnamon basil cilantro coriander water spinach fish mint scallions chives parsley and celery an instructor teaches a class to make banh xeo a savoury rice flour crepe folded over stuffed herbs shrimp pork and bean sprouts as i dip my feet in the pool an american relaxes on a sunbed recounting her class experience and enjoying her creation served with peanut sauce banh xeo looks like an omelette and i am surprised there is no egg involved just powdered turmeric over the next few days my family and i head daily to the ancient town where we feast in between fittings at the tailor on both street and gourmet food specialities at morning glory 106 nguyen thai hoc street a restaurant established by trinh diem vy a renowned local chef we unanimously agree that the mackerel cubes wrapped in banana leaf with chopped wood ear mushrooms and turmeric as well as the five spice pork belly are stand outs another day my husband makes a quick detour to locate a store famous for its banh mi a popular local baguette of french origin but made with a local twist using rice flour in addition to wheat flour a symphony in a sandwich american celebrity chef anthony bourdain had proclaimed of the baguettes made at banh mi phuong 2b phan chau trinh we try an assortment of banh mi and discover why the original with delicious grilled pork pork liver pate meat floss cheese pork patty cilantro mint spring onion and topped with a secret homemade dressing is most sought after we experience the most internationally influenced food at mango rooms 111 nguyen thai hoc street its chef and proprietor tran thanh duc whips up an array of delectable dishes marrying east and west such as pearl of china seas tempura battered prawns tossed in garlic butter and la cubana beef cubes flame broiled with cuban rum and served with latino style salsa the fern green and teal walls and vividly coloured cushions and chairs evoke a laid back vibe somewhat reminiscent of the caribbean as we watch boats bobbing on the thu bon river chef tran's outfit perhaps epitomises the way forward as locals begin to venture abroad and tourism demands the fusion of old and new on our fifth and final morning in hoi an our in house villa cook asks for our last breakfast order my family requests individual breakfast staples they have enjoyed both western and vietnamese but i am indecisive choose something you will remember hoi an for the villa manager prompts with a smile i pause for a moment mentally racing through the contrasting flavours and worldly influences of hoi an

        "content": "china is vast and that becomes most palpable when speeding through the country on a bullet train mega cities and modern industrial zones flash endlessly past my window at 300kmh but the country's high speed rail network the world's longest at 30 000km this year and counting also conveys an intimate portrait of the nation like me the traveller can plan forays into little water towns such as wuzhen or the oldest existing section of the great wall in jinan while the train network is all about on the dot schedules it also empowers free spirits towards the end of our week long trip the sunday times' executive multimedia videographer ashleigh sim and i decide to go off plan and see how far the rail network can take us rolling into the lesser known chinese city of dandong to peer into north korea turns out to be an easy day trip from shenyang on our 2 000km journey northwards from shanghai to dandong china feels at once ancient and cool in jinan a hipster cat cafe favoured by sullen artsy millennials sits by a spring fed canal in qushuiting street where scholar bureaucrats once composed poetry with trays of alcohol wafting on the water in shenyang a manchu palace complex with a faded glory is streets away from sleek skyscrapers with over the top illumination at night such contrasting facets of china are heightened when superfast trains zip us from one experience to the next on a multi city itinerary like venice china has towns built on intricate canal systems we spend a day in wuzhen one of the pretty water towns in the triangle formed by fabled cities shanghai suzhou and hangzhou wuzhen at 1 300 years old is a glimpse of old china with its arched stone bridges and step into the past experiences a flower drum street opera that depicts rural life and a niche hundred bed museum of antique beds for instance twice a day on a lofty swaying bamboo pole high above the water an acrobat rivets tourists with terrifying stunts it is far more serene to walk under indigo banners that evoke a period drama scene at a dye workshop or to sip sanbai rice wine from a ming era distillery while i travel back in time in this eastern zone of wuzhen where residents still go about daily life amid gawkers the revamped western part is more a mix of old and new here amid limpid canals and alleys wuzhen goes modern with an annual internet conference and an international theatre festival the mu xin art museum designed by top architect i m pei's students hiroshi okamoto and bing lin has an exhibition by french novelist and playwright honore de balzac in september when i visit coolness also abounds in a wedding museum perfect for instagram boutique hotels and small soulful bars by the water jinan a city of natural springs is another portrait of cool china we go up the thousand buddha mountain by cable car then on foot for a view of modern jinan better still we whoosh down the foliage clad hill in a luge a fun ride of six minutes for me but less for speedsters the hill has buddha statues from the sui dynasty 581 to 618 carved into the cliffs by devotees while newer sculptures are planted along a paved trail china loves its qr codes even at the millennia old black tiger spring so named because the small natural spring roars out from dark rock i scan a qr code to activate a bronze sculpture spring water duly pours out and i sip also whimsical is kuanhouli street an enclave of indie shops bars and hip hawker stalls mainly it is where locals go for a walking feast under the night sky savour volcanic or spicy barbecued squid mini sushi innards in hot broth stinky tofu doused in mala sauce traditional donkey dumplings italian desserts trendy yogurt drinks thai tea and more it is fun to observe young chinese enjoying old school street snacks from grilled pig's tail to braised trotters kuanhouli is playful affordable global retro and local a winsome combination for visitors outside jinan the great wall of qi is the oldest remnant of the fortification the qi state started building this section in 685bc what remains are piles of stones that seem unremarkable but poignantly carry the story of china's past i think about its wars and nomadic invasions and the longevity of this civilisation entering shenyang at twilight the north eastern city feels like a different china with its manchurian legacy and blend of korean japanese and russian influences the mukden palace built in the image of the forbidden city in beijing in 1626 is the only remaining manchu palace complex in the world it is like a city with smaller palaces a multitude of pavilions and a library there are courtyards gardens and passageways for a bit of respite from the summer crowd at the unesco world heritage site there is a sense of grander days royal concubines liked tea tasting calligraphy and dressing up glazed crockery fine hair combs and gems on display in one of the palaces allude to a languorous lifestyle dwelling in china's north east is a huge korean diaspora it includes the descendants of koreans who fled to china after the 1910 japanese occupation now north koreans also work here xita street is a fusion experience of the two koreas where pyongyang pomp meets k pop in pingrang guan pyongyang restaurant spirited north korean waitresses in high heels speak flawless mandarin as they serve our flavourful lunch that includes cold noodles in a sweet sour sauce and fresh cabbage kimchi our server ushers us to a quieter spot away from karaoke warblers my english is powerful she decides but it is unreal to view what is on television in the dated chandelier lit space scenes of military splendour roll repeatedly across the screen when we return for that night's dinner show she sends us to a table with two chinese guests when she spies us loitering by a pillar in the full house like her the other waitresses chosen for their beauty and talent double as polished performers in hanbok and slinky satin in between singing and dancing on stage they hurry to the tables to round off our korean moment we pop into a market that peddles anything from fresh ginseng to kimchi we stop by a small stylish mall with k cosmetic brands such as etude house and laneige i love lingering in angel in us coffee a chill second floor cafe away from shenyang's hubbub we sink into plush armchairs surrounded by korean chests for iced latte and light pastries we wonder how far the high speed rail network can take us and decide to go further north to dandong the chinese city closest to north korea for much of the world dandong is obscure but its star will rise if there is a rapprochement between united states president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un already the trains and trucks trundling between dandong and sinuiju on the north korean side carry much of the trade between the two countries even if united nations sanctions have dampened activity the yalu river separates the two cities but they are only centimetres away at the closest point a sign says one stride across on a cruise at the yalu river scenic area we catch glimpses of north koreans including three boatmen a woman washing at the river's edge and a bare chested man at a farm patch there is also a cigarette factory and war relics but otherwise the scene looks pastoral in summertime this is the closest we can get to north korea without a visa it also makes us think same countryside different nations and divergent fates later in town we head to the intriguing yalu river broken bridge that once linked the twain after the americans bombed the bridge in 1950 the north koreans dismantled the tangled mess on their side the chinese converted the rest of the structure into an impressive walkway and a viewing platform here from the middle of the river i gaze at an abandoned ferris wheel and water slide in sinuiju a circular peach hotel looks just as bereft as the empty amusement park next to the dilapidated north korean showcase dandong looks optimistic with its sleek buildings and relaxed weekenders reflecting much of the verve and coolness i have encountered on my chinese rail journey follow lee siew hua on twitter stsiewhua this story was brought to you by travel activities and services booking platform klook this concludes a three part rail travel series that earlier highlighted switzerland and japan bullet trains are a savvy way to see multiple cities on one trip in a land as expansive and connected as china with a network topping 30 000km this year the choice of destinations is seemingly endless comfortable punctual and safe the superfast trains have been whizzing travellers on long distance trips since 2008 when the high speed rail network started running begin your journey in a popular and richly linked city like beijing shanghai or xi'an and fan out to other places countries such as japan and switzerland sell rail passes good for unlimited rides for most trains and other modes of transportation in their networks the passes are valid for a fixed time for instance seven days the difference is that in china travellers buy individual tickets for each point to point journey instead of an all encompassing rail pass tickets can be purchased online usually 30 days in advance klook does not charge booking fees for tickets purchased on its platform another plus when buying tickets for multiple cities the traveller's details are saved for an easier check out after booking an e voucher for each ticket will be generated inside your klook app and also sent to your e mail address it is a good idea to keep printed copies of the tickets to pick up tickets in china give yourself an average of 45 to 60 minutes at the railway station as travellers have to pass through security like at the airport look for the ticket counter and present your passport and ticket e voucher or printed copy to collect the tickets note that automatic ticket kiosks are for citizens foreigners working in china and travellers from hong kong and macau each ticket shows all the information needed including gate number train carriage and seat gates generally open 15 minutes before departure train rides are pleasant with huge picture windows and also because smoking is prohibited announcements are in mandarin and english hot water from dispensers is available for tea and instant noodles or order food and drinks in the dining car on some trains you can scan qr codes at your seat to order bento sets and chinese snacks such as hot milky red bean tea for seats there is a choice of first and second classes sometimes there is a business class cabin that is cushier than first class once on a business class ticket between jinan and shenyang i get a fully reclining seat bedroom slippers snacks and water and lots of room for luggage there is a train attendant for the cabin which seats passengers in a 2 1 configuration that one way ticket for a 51 2 hour journey cost 1 172 5 yuan s 226 another business ticket for a 30 minute ride from shanghai to suzhou cost 119 5 yuan for train lovers the adventure continues with new tracks constantly added by an ambitious and fastgrowing nation intent on ferrying its huge population to every province the chinese network at 30 000km is already two thirds of the entire planet's inventory of tracks i flew into shanghai pudong international airport on singapore airlines for our seven day high speed rail journey we transferred by car from the airport to shanghai hongqiao railway station for a 30 minute train ride to suzhou north railway station from suzhou we travelled to wuzhen water town for a day trip by car departing from suzhou north we took another high speed train to jinan west railway station a journey of 31 2 hours our longest stretch was from jinan west to the shenyang railway station which took nearly 51 2 hours from shenyang we went off the high speed rail network for a day trip to dandong on the north korean border the ride was still a speedy 90 minutes we ended our trip in shenyang where we flew to singapore on xiamen airlines train tickets were purchased on klook which runs a website and app tips 1 download the wechat super app to connect with the chinese and to use qr codes travellers may need to chat with their drivers for airport transfers for instance or you can scan qr codes at attractions to learn more and order food on the train whatsapp is not the messaging app of choice in china 2 locals will have opinions on where to eat in suzhou for instance residents describe their cuisine as light and sweet and recommend places for hairy crab unwind with a walk around the neighbourhood or a park after dinner and mingle with locals who are likely also curious about singapore in jinan a walk reveals the texture of daily chinese life retirees walk their dogs condominium residents put up led signs peddling yoga and calligraphy lessons on the facade posters tout patriotism at a primary school on the train there are opportunities to chat a harbin military retiree who was upgraded to our business class cabin as veterans are revered pithily compares northerners sincere and warm hearted with

in china watch out for bicycle riders before you emerge from the car also motorcyclists may cruise on the pavement but this attitude can also work to your benefit at one train station where we were

said come back during the last slot at 8pm that evening i joined team pfizer thoughts of safer travels bounced happily in my head singapore's vaccine roll out and the robust pandemic controls are the envy of many countries in april the bloomberg covid resilience ranking named singapore the safest place in the world to be during the pandemic with the nation ramping up its vaccination rate and targeting to have two thirds of the population fully inoculated by around national day more activities will resume in a calibrated style so the republic is expected to stay high on the chart also health minister ong ye kung has hinted at a return to leisure travel by the end of the year though borders may open and close again with covid 19 variants it is clear that vaccination and testing will become de rigueur for travel here is what you should know about post vaccine travel at a time when borders are starting to reopen singapore's health authorities have bet strategically on the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines which have the highest efficacy rates following the approval by the world health organisation who for emergency use singapore granted china's sinovac vaccine a special access route through licensed private healthcare practitioners however it is not under the republic's national vaccine programme as swathes of territories reopen some will offer vaccinated travellers quarantine free entry recovered covid 19 cases or non vaccinated travellers will have more hoops to jump through the vaccine is a traveller's silver bullet it provides acceptance and access and gives me peace of mind says ms eva wang an investment manager based in dubai and a fellow traveller who has visited more than 50 countries the 27 member states of the european union eu may accept non eu tourists from low risk countries if they have received the approved doses from pfizer biontech moderna oxford astrazeneca and johnson johnson this may further expand to include who's emergency use listings such as china's sinopharm and sinovac some countries are already giving vaccinated travellers a free pass since july 1 iceland has waived on arrival covid 19 tests allowing visitors to hit the road immediately united states based research scientist ethan brodsky another travel buddy visited iceland twice in two months recently i feel so alive travelling again and i am looking forward to returning to singapore to check on the urban otters he says with a chuckle nearer home phuket in thailand has waived its quarantine requirements for vaccinated travellers since july 1 after two weeks in phuket vaccinated travellers who test negative for covid 19 can roam throughout the kingdom discriminatory as it may sound more travel operators that organise experiences in confined spaces are not taking chances natural habitat adventures a us based outdoor operator requires all clients to be fully vaccinated for its global trips from this month its website says we seek to be responsible travellers in the places we visit which includes doing our part to mitigate the spread of covid 19 the award winning agency plans life changing wildlife experiences for small groups of nature lovers a five night expedition in a mobile lodge on the frozen arctic tundra costs us 10 000 s 13 500 a person on a twin share basis polar bears snuggle up to the lodge pressing their noses against the walls as breakfast is prepared cruise operators meanwhile are accepting only fully vaccinated passengers on selected sailings royal caribbean for example requires all passengers and crew to be fully vaccinated for cruises leaving from israel the bahamas bermuda cyprus and britain no jab no go says a cruise industry operator whose ships move between europe and south america we can't afford to lock down or turn around a ship because of a single passenger there are four important items in my 2 daiso vinyl bag passport an envelope of foreign currencies international driving licence and a tattered yellow who booklet of my vaccination records the latest addition is a hard copy of my digital covid 19 vaccine certificate after my second dose i was given an old school copy of my covid 19 vaccine certificate as a keepsake now an electronic pdf copy is attached to my account under the national healthhub app but this is scant in details and will not pass muster at international borders take it one step further notarise it and create a digitised version just use your singpass to log into the national platform for validating digital documents in four simple steps within a minute i received my digital vaccine certificate in my e mail complete with a qr code plus details of my passport identity card and the vaccination shots whether it is a vaccine passport or a pass airlines and health and travel authorities are scrambling to come up with efficient tamper proof documents to verify one's health status as travel picks up the eu's green certificate aims to enable quarantine free travel among its member states singapore airlines was the first in the world to live test the international air transport association iata travel pass iata which counts about 290 member airlines worldwide has more than 70 airlines committed to trials of its app the pass provides assurance to the authorities that travellers are vaccinated and covid 19 tested via endorsed laboratories it also helps to verify that border entry requirements are met at check in or at immigration it is not possible for the passenger to tamper with the data says mr vinoop goel iata regional director airports and external relations asia pacific in response to queries from the straits times checks are also in place to ensure the passenger's identity is correct he adds that iata has worked with the singapore authorities to incorporate its vaccine certificate into the app it is free to download but password access is provided only by the airline you are travelling on because of high testing costs fake certificates have surfaced in countries such as britain the netherlands france pakistan and india the indonesian police also broke up a syndicate and reported that about 9 000 people were given reused nose swabs in medan's airport such abuses make it critical to have a reliable internationally accepted endorsement of one's health status a two week phuket jaunt now requires a thai embassy issued certificate of entry a pre departure covid 19 test covid 19 insurance specifically for thailand three covid 19 tests in phuket and a pre returning covid 19 test for singapore plus there is a 14 day quarantine to welcome you home multiply that by the number of travellers in your family and the sunk costs are alarmingly high it only makes sense to travel more purposefully and to take a longer trip families with unvaccinated kids may face a dilemma as they unravel the rules at each destination at a time when health authorities are mulling over vaccination age limits and what a balanced approach to quarantine should entail in phuket's case quarantine is waived for unvaccinated children under 18 if travelling with vaccinated parents but that also means exposing the kids to the virus a milestone trip will never be worthwhile if a child is infected with covid 19 and the delta variant has certainly caused an increase in the number of younger cases canada strikes a delicate balance returning vaccinated citizens with negative test results skip quarantine completely but unvaccinated children below the age of 18 need to quarantine at home for 14 days i know of a business owner from an asean country who sneaked in a getaway to istanbul during the hari raya puasa holiday in may upon returning home she paid us 1 500 in service fees to a medical agent to short circuit her quarantine stay she was released from quarantine after a three night stay her brother contracted covid 19 last december and her father was stricken last month and last week her mother and younger sister tested positive the business owner is the only person in the family who is covid 19 free there was no contact tracing done when her family members fell ill covid 19 will become endemic but unfortunately inept governance and corruption are already endemic to some degree across the region a region wide bubble is still dangerous with the pandemic far from over covid 19 outbreaks can occur overnight shortly after my full vaccination in april i started planning a june bucket list trip to the seychelles with a stopover in dubai before dovetailing my journey with the phuket reopening this month it was going to be my two month revenge trip at that time the borders of the seychelles and dubai were fully open both had among the world's most vaccinated populations but in may the positive rates spiked for both countries i canned the trip without much hesitation reasons for the jump in the number of infections are unclear but observers have pointed out that the seychelles reopened its borders in march removed all quarantine measures and relied solely on covid 19 test results about 60 per cent of the vaccine doses administered in the country were sinopharm with the rest being india made astrazeneca vaccine doses bloomberg reported the united arab emirates uae is now offering those vaccinated with sinopharm a third shot as a booster as the number of its daily new covid 19 cases stays persistently above 1 000 which is higher than last december when it started its vaccination programme the uae has since added pfizer biontech russia's sputnik v and oxford astrazeneca to its list of vaccines as people gingerly move towards the reopening of borders curbs may come and go they just need to take sudden changes in their stride while mitigating the risks the world cannot live in a cocoon forever while i plan with hope i will monitor the covid 19 cases for my intended destinations book with careful examination of the cancellation policies and take up covid 19 travel insurance fresh air is in while densely packed cities are out for me animals and nature are in festivals with heaving bodies are out with the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 people took steps to return to travel you can't fax a handshake i recall a catchy television advertisement saying at that time this time it is more challenging with more baby steps required but i will add you can't zoom a hug after a travel hiatus lasting 18 months john tan will embark on a business trip to canada followed by a revenge trip around the caribbean get infected with covid 19 overseas and you will be barred from returning home until your pre departure test at your destination is negative that is the current stance of the authorities this could mean a week or more in isolation and in the worst case it is hospitalisation or dedicated facilities with the locals says a local infectious disease doctor who requests anonymity with medical fees or treatment extended stays and rescheduled tickets the costs for contracting covid 19 while overseas may easily run into five figures for each infected person this is where covid 19 insurance provides an important safety net for travellers the definition of essential travel is still murky and subject to arbitrary interpretation however a singapore airlines sia economy ticket to los angeles for travel at the end of this month costs 1 170 based on a three month trip to the united states the airline sells an enhanced covid 19 cover add on travel insurance at 941 almost the same price of the ticket but since a leisure trip to the united states is against the ministry of health's moh travel advisory it is void against covid 19 cover you are thus covered only for typical travel mishaps yet aig the insurer sia works with prices in the risk premium for the covid 19 pandemic and takes the cue from the health authorities' travel advisories so you may end up buying an expensive lemon just remember covid 19 coverage is good only for countries within travel advisories and these are easily counted on 10 fingers like the airlines most insurers sing a reassuring tune about safe travel and some dangle covid 19 quarantine allowances and promise extended covid 19 covers but you need to do due diligence to spot the tripwires and sift through the legal jargon of the terms and conditions that run into many pages plans such as allianz travel aig travel guard direct aia around the world plus and axa wanderlust travel do challenge your familiarity with travel insurance ignore their fine print at your own peril japanese insurer sompo admirably highlights on its main page that it does not cover people who travel against advisories so far research shows that ntuc income is the only insurer that offers covid 19 cover even when travelling against moh's advisories its main caveat is that the covid 19 coverage excludes high risk countries as defined by the world health organisation which reviews the list every month the coverage depends on the time of the purchase and the corresponding list of countries for its current listing valid till july 25 popular travel destinations such as the us japan and most eu countries are not classified as high risk and thus covered by insurance but do note that india is not deemed high risk and enjoys cover while malaysia is deemed high risk these are the main features for ntuc income's coverage standard travel coverage is for a maximum of 180 days with the first 90 days provided with covid 19 cover for instance its classic plan single trip for worldwide destinations costs 1 369 for 180 days inclusive of 90 days of covid 19 cover about 8 a day annual plans do not cover covid 19 and are cheaper covid 19 cover will require a top up a trip costing about 9 a day covid 19 cover includes in patient and medical expenses on top of standard medical cover non hospitalisation costs such as isolation at hotels if you get covid 19 and other out of pocket expenses are not included a year ago emirates was the first airline globally to provide free covid 19 coverage for its ticketed passengers even if they take trips against travel advisories today it is continuing to do so and still setting the gold standard besides medical coverage for covid 19 its free perks include daily quarantine allowances and trip cancellations for non refundable losses str sg 3jna cathay pacific also offers free covid 19 cover for those who travel against advisories japan airlines provides free covid 19 cover for travels that are within advisories new variants may continue to emerge and a zero covid 19 world is almost impossible but with substantial vaccination rates an endemic approach towards travel is required to lift its recovery and sustain important travel related sectors and to retrieve some form of normality catch all restrictions may have to be tweaked and tailored specifically there should be a difference between high risk and low risk countries taking a cue from who's list for example also travellers should be differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated between citizens and visitors this is not discriminatory it is about applying a new set of rules

        "content": "a traveller's greatest fear is probably a medical emergency overseas lost items and flight delays pale in comparison a covid 19 positive diagnosis means quarantine in an unfamiliar environment language barriers and differing medical standards a cocktail of travel nightmares expensive too airlines travel agents and insurers are scrambling to mitigate costs for the traveller covid 19 covers for example are tagged to air tickets or the standard travel insurance here is a rundown of some covid 19 coverage and the trip wires to be mindful of think of travel advisory as the mother of all travel catchphrases during the pandemic travel advisories are issued by the countries of departure for departing travellers in singapore the ministry of health moh issues the advisories travel bans however are usually entry and border controls imposed by a destination against foreign travellers travel advisories and travel bans are not wedded in bliss a local underwriter notes insurers he admits complicate matters with their own list of countries deemed out of bounds some countries like britain and the united states welcome singapore passports but local authorities do not endorse general leisure travel there conversely singapore's authorities may endorse travel to certain destinations for instance australia and new zealand but this is not reciprocated in its latest travel update on oct 1 moh endorsed general travel to only four countries new zealand australia vietnam and brunei out of 193 united nations members quarantine bookending the start and end of a trip deflates the euphoria of a holiday as the pandemic continues the lessons learnt will lead to a gradual reopening of borders amid safe measures and best practices travellers will remain cautious but they yearn to hit the road again i fantasise about a festive getaway and if things are still sketchy i can always change my mind but the trip planning itself is a fun respite i need hope says a travel buddy who has spent every winter in europe the past decade singapore's ministry of health as of oct 1 endorses general travel to only four countries australia except victoria state vietnam new zealand and brunei travellers to these countries need not face a stay home notice shn quarantine on returning to singapore subject to negative covid 19 swab tests outside these countries it is a 14 day shn in dedicated facilities or seven day shn at one's own accommodation str sg j2mz while singapore has waived its quarantine requirements for the four countries they have not reciprocated their borders are closed to non essential travel however there are a dozen countries that do not require quarantine for singapore travellers currently travel platform kayak counts 62 countries with open borders half of which are quarantine free for selected visitors though a covid 19 negative certification may be required examples include brazil and colombia str sg j2wc a savvy traveller will point out that avoiding overseas quarantine is more important than worrying about singapore's shn quarantine upon return right now a singapore traveller can avoid quarantine to a dozen territories examples include britain united states united arab emirates only via dubai honduras dominican republic belarus ukraine and french polynesia for some countries such as egypt only direct flights would qualify bit ly 2govc62 singapore has stabilised its pandemic situation with rigorous contact tracing testing and regulatory frameworks however some countries fail to see beyond the republic's zealous efforts in comparison travellers from thailand currently have more quarantine free and border access globally than singapore but as the local community infection peters out the singapore traveller will increasingly be welcomed sia's direct connections that do not require quarantine in pandemic times direct flights are default choices transits are riskier based on national carrier singapore airlines' schedule till end december there are direct connections to 28 countries of these under current restrictions singapore leisure travellers may fly directly to britain us turkey maldives and south africa without enduring quarantine on arrival str sg j2wt go farther with vacation hubs quarantine free hubs offer a vacation while providing an incubation window for farther regional travel for example a singapore traveller can fly into britain vacation for two weeks and move farther for instance to france and the netherlands these countries currently do not permit direct access by singapore travellers but welcome passengers departing from britain alternatively the us is a hub and spoke link to nearby caribbean islands as well as central and south america but be mindful of the return leg as the us imposes restrictions on travellers arriving from certain south american or central american destinations in the middle east uae's main hub of dubai is open though sia does not fly to dubai currently emirates has direct flights between singapore and dubai singapore travellers can stay at dubai to travel to other regional destinations regional trips on back burner with quarantine waiting for singaporeans back home longer holidays make more sense time and budget permitting weekend leisure trips within asean will not return until singapore relaxes its shn requirements or travel bubbles are formed meanwhile i will plan in anticipation but will still err on the side of caution to stay safe john tan for official and business travel under its reciprocal green lane and bilateral arrangements there are china malaysia south korea and japan www moh gov sg covid 19 besides leisure and essential travel student travel that meets requirements is also endorsed beyond these eight countries and conditions all other travels are against moh travel advisories and they are not covered by covid 19 insurance from mid august national carrier singapore airlines sia through underwriter aig offered covid 19 cover protection as part of a standard travel insurance plan passengers who purchase round trip tickets are covered for pre departure trip cancellations trip curtailment losses covid 19 related overseas medical expenses repatriation and quarantine allowance expenses overseas str sg j2wy limited to singapore residents flying with sia and silkair the travel insurance starts at 34 for a three day asean coverage and goes up to a staggering 1 757 for a 180 day worldwide cover its subsidiary scoot has also teamed up with insurer axa to provide a more modest covid 19 cover str sg j2wg however these supplements apply only to moh's approved travel destinations or essential travel in july middle eastern airline emirates with insurer allianz nextcare launched the world's first standalone covid 19 cover deemed the gold standard it comes with two outstanding features first it is a four letter word free second it covers against travel advisories except under an outright travel ban str sg j2wm also onward destinations are covered for up to 31 days the cover stops when the passenger returns to the home base whichever is earlier the scheme proved so popular that it is now extended until the end of december in early september etihad airways jumped on the bandwagon with its travel cover which is underwritten by axa gulf the cover is similar to the emirates scheme can people buy cover against travel advisories issuers in the us and europe underwrite travel insurance with covid 19 cover for overseas travellers headed to selected destinations they have different exclusions and may differentiate between trip insurance and medical insurance comprehensive plans are also available str sg j2wa for example global travel underwriter img sirius international's coveramerica gold provides coverage for non us residents citizens travelling to the us plus canada mexico latin america the bahamas and south america for a 30 day coverage the insured person receives comprehensive travel insurance with covid 19 screening benefit and quarantine cover its us 250 000 s 339 000 policy limit plan costs us 216 but there are caveats such as deductibles varying levels of reimbursements and exclusions due to us sanctions overseas administrators and underwriters may be more regimented it is administratively more cumbersome to file a claim against a foreign underwriter in a different time zone i cringe when i recall a previous claim with a major us insurer due to bad weather a high altitude central asia flight was cancelled with the airport shut down indefinitely the airline advised me to make an overland trip instead since the spotty weather might continue for the next two to three days i took a hazardous 16 hour private car hire over mountainous gravel roads yet the us insurer rejected my claim and said i should have waited for the weather to clear after three months a dozen e mails and many phone calls culminating in an escalation of my case to its senior management my claim was approved it was a good outcome but what a frustrating exercise thus i would still prefer to buy cover through a singapore administrator an insurance cover is only good if a valid claim is fairly reimbursed expeditiously advises an insurer contact who declines to be named the national association of travel agents singapore natas in conjunction with maybank's etiqa is working out a covid 19 specific travel cover it covers travel postponement medical expenses and hospital allowances a standout is post trip medical expenses in singapore an etiqa spokesman says the plan once finalised will be made available through natas' agents sadly but understandably the plan will adhere to moh's travel advisories and their limitations yet it would serve those leisure and business travellers who are journeying in compliance with the advisories covid 19 cover ends when people get home there is no post trip cover available currently even the plans that are administered overseas stop short of a post trip cover so covid 19 swab tests stay home notices or quarantine expenses at designated facilities are out of pocket expenses moreover travellers who venture out despite moh's advisories and test positive within 14 days of their return will not receive any government subsidies or medical benefits for their treatment it is a sobering thought as that could easily add a few thousand dollars of expenses to the trip pandemic covers may emerge as a new normal the world with closed borders on an extended basis is not the new normal but certainly a cavalier attitude in travel remains out of limits under normal circumstances people choose carriers based on personal preferences such as flight schedule budget loyalty programme and service quality among other factors but if i really need to travel beyond moh's endorsed list of destinations i would give serious thought to flying emirates its less restrictive covid 19 cover is assuring and meaningful people may baulk at existing covid 19 covers with their weak inclusions and numerous exclusions yet however limited they may be it beats zero cover for any traveller i would not leave home without it just be

        "content": "singapore a two to four night cruise to nowhere can be breezed through fairly quickly there are no grinding crunching chains when the ship drops anchor in the middle of the night as it slips into safe haven an annoying sleep disruption to any passenger at the ship's fore there is no mad scramble for land excursions importantly medical situations can be readily handled since ports are almost within sight this transpired just last week when the quantum of the seas cruise ship sailed back to singapore because of a suspected covid 19 case on board though that turned out to be a false alarm over the years i have cruised a dozen times the shortest was a weekend getaway to nowhere and the longest was a 22 night polar dive expedition to antarctica amid the waves sea spray and occasional pesky bird droppings here are some lessons learnt and tips to make a cruise experience better short trippers may end up taking a cruise on impulse or wrap their getaways around their time off windows most ignore the weather i plan my cruises around weather forecasts and seasons a cruise is less enjoyable when the days are continuously bathed in seven shades of grey i will not cruise to be cooped up in the cabin or indoors it is strange to wear a bikini in the rain by the pool quips 35 year old bank executive tina lim the seven cruise veteran who packs half a dozen swimsuits for her sojourns checks the weather religiously before nailing down a cruise date in addition during bad weather certain outdoor facilities or activities are curtailed for safety and practical reasons families with kids may be less bothered by this as they can resort to more mundane indoor facilities photo buffs best understand the conditions required to get images of a molten sun amid crimson skies or sparkling city lights at the perfect blue hour thus if time is flexible avoid sailing on days when there is extended bad weather on the radar we are now entering into wettest months of the monsoon season incidentally time a cruise around key dates for example passengers travelling during new year's eve will be treated to stunning fireworks ships worldwide fire flares and blast air horns to welcome the new year valentine's day cruises are always popular full moon sailings offer shimmering seas which add that sprinkle of romance to a cruise let the booking agent know if it is a special occasion or celebration a birthday cake or a bottle of sparkling wine may be waiting in the cabin honeymooners might snag a cabin upgrade the two ships currently operating out of singapore are royal caribbean international's quantum of the seas and dream cruises' world dream both mega ships are among the world's largest with an overall length matching an american nuclear aircraft carrier and they are tiered like wedding cakes that spill over with innovative features and facilities forget ping pong tables old school games arcades or kids' face painting sessions quantum of the seas takes it to the next level with its cherry picker style observation capsule robotic bartenders bumper car hall sky diving and surfing stimulators among others and you are unlikely to eat your way through all its 14 restaurants in the span of three or four nights world dream offers a ritzy hotel within a hotel for those willing to pay more it is big on game stimulators virtual reality and motion theatres think universal studios and you get an idea it boasts an array of 35 dining options and bars for both ships some dining outlets are inclusive while the speciality ones require payment the same applies to selected activities as well decide on the facilities that appeal to you some require more physical participation while others are more docile yet allow younger kids to scream their heads off take along your own dom perignon or grand cru for a special candlelight dining experience my window view is 80 per cent blocked by an orange lifeboat dangling from the ceiling that lament from a fellow cruise passenger was her introductory line when we exchanged pleasantries during an inner passage alaska cruise a few years back she pleaded unsuccessfully to change the cabin with the hotel manager passengers on short cruises may be more forgiving if they land in a badly located cabin if a choice is available make an effort to go through the deck plans and layouts if grandma is joining the trip pick a cabin nearer the lifts or on the dining room deck cruises to nowhere do not face gale force winds or towering waves so the higher the deck the more majestic the view in rough open seas mid ship lower decks are better the system generates the cabin allotment check prices online but also speak to the booking agent to assist on cabin options it is difficult or costly to make changes once the system allocates the cabin the software of a cruise ship the crew and it is often overlooked be it a short or long cruise i always make it a point to know my cabin steward the waitress at my favourite section of the dining hall the bartender the hotel manager and the pool deck hand these new friends can make the next few days smoother sailing some words in tagalog will go a long way the filipinos are masters in hospitality and are well represented on ships most important perhaps is the maitre d' he or she decides the seating arrangements it may mean either a romantic table by the window or a table hemmed in by two noisy families the captain is king but he is far too distant decide on the dining options before boarding the crew is always more relaxed and attentive during the last seating but you may be late for the evening showtimes once on board i make a beeline to my selected speciality restaurants soonest to parlay my requests talk to the crew manning the popular facilities and seek their advice on the best timings or the best vantage point for photography be nice but be real both ships slap around 15 per cent service charge on the cabin prices a person this is a fair arrangement given that tips are integral to the crew's income provided that it is not some sinister scheme by the management to boost revenue with cruise gratuities automatically charged both our front line and behind the scene crew members who play a crucial role in creating guest experiences will be equally rewarded and recognised says mr michael goh president of dream cruises and head of international sales genting cruise lines in response to queries passenger s h raja who has cruised between asean ports such as in malaysia and vietnam and far east ones in japan china and taiwan says upfront gratuities eliminate the instances of passengers who do not understand the standard etiquette some passengers are tight fisted and treat tipping as getting rid of loose change in the wallet and in these pandemic times the crew works doubly hard more cleaning more care and more attentiveness the hours are longer and harder now and the cap on passengers shrinks the tip pool thus show more gratitude recognise exceptional service with a further tip even if the gratuities are pre paid i make a mental note of the waiter who remembers my weakness for desserts and quietly provides double helpings my chirpy steward who cleans the cabin spotlessly and slips extra chocolates on the bed during turn down service the restaurant manager's attentive but unobtrusive service the mixologist who makes excellent cocktails the deck hand helping to reserve my favourite shaded spot by the pool tip only in the local currency or in major currencies such as us dollars and euros getting rid of the spare renminbi or rupiah is not sincere with the current pandemic the health and safety culture has been rewritten for both passengers and crew the recent covid 19 false alarm aboard quantum of the seas has sharpened the learning curve for the cruise industry more importantly it demonstrated that the pilot cruise programme has a robust efficient health response system in place for those yearning for a cruise cation sailing at half the maximum capacity is a big draw with seven crew members for every 10 passengers this is an almost unprecedented level of care and attention and at slightly more than 300 a night with full board for two persons plus entertainment that is a pretty good deal the writer's most recent cruise was a 22 night expedition to antarctica in

        "content": "singapore a couple from singapore booked a private jet to the maldives for a 10 day romantic getaway last month after the paradise nation reopened borders in mid july flying in style with champagne and delicacies served by an air stewardess garbed in personal protective equipment the duo were the only passengers on a gulfstream g150 jet that can seat half a dozen the price tag for a socially distanced flight on a mid sized aircraft like this us 50 000 s 68 000 or more one way the escape out of seletar airport was brokered by air charter service which opened its singapore office in march when passengers everywhere were scrambling to fly home before swathes of the world went into lockdown between april and last month the company clocked three times more charters in and out of singapore compared with the same period last year mr brendan toomey its chief executive here says customised flights have heightened appeal now that privacy safety and flexible departures are desirable in a pandemic take safety a private air passenger encounters only about 40 people from home to hotel check in he says for commercial flights the average rises to 700 encounters in this light chartered flights are enjoying a surge in business globally as passengers many of them flying privately for the first time make the flight to safety said aviation companies and recent reports last month the world economic forum in a report published in partnership with non profit news organisation the conversation said we are also witnessing a rise in the use of individuals and organisations hiring private jets as short term solutions to avoiding airport delays some british universities have also chartered private jets for incoming international students as a way to ensure a steady flow of income the report added new york based brand building consultancy firm finn partners listed five ways private jets are shaping aviation trends including with flexible timings you are not restricted to stringent timings like those of commercial airline schedules you create your very own schedule read its blog post published last month if you're running late the plane will wait for you or if you want to change your departure time this can easily be done the bellagraph nova group which put in a takeover bid for newcastle united football club claimed on its instagram account that it has over 10 000 private jets at its disposal the post was edited later to remove the number while private jets have an aura of exclusivity the truth is that they are not only for ultra high net worth individuals like russian billionaires and hollywood stars besides students aviation companies have also repatriated stranded cruise ship staff to their home countries after commercial flights were widely disrupted from singapore air charter service a british company with access to 50 000 jets on six continents has sent a marine engineer to the philippines to attend to a cargo ship mr toomey says his company supports clients who need to move including rotating crew from ships or cargo aircraft who normally rely on commercial airlines the company has also repatriated families to phnom penh and professionals to india some services are relatively affordable especially if clients fill every seat and choose not to have a flight attendant or catered meal on board a shorter regional route such as from singapore to phnom penh starts at about us 20 000 for a super light aircraft and the cost can be split among six or seven passengers still in asia a business jet is perceived as a luxury compared with in other markets mr dennis lau an analyst at cirium an aviation analytics company says most people in asia view it as a luxury item while in mature markets such as the united states business jets are mostly seen as a business tool to help companies increase productivity singapore is one of the few major cities in asia to have a second airport available to handle business flights he notes and a misperception is that private jets can skirt border controls mr lau says international travellers are subject to the same restrictions whether they travel by business jet or commercial airline flights although private jets also face travel restrictions their appeal is growing and aviation companies are innovating the experience for these times global business aviation company vistajet announced in july that it had embedded the tempus ic2 vital signs monitor within its global fleet in case of illness on board air crew can measure and transmit the clinical data of the patient in real time to ground based medical experts 24 7 mr thomas flohr vistajet's founder and chairman said it is the next best thing to having a doctor by your side also in july qatar airways announced its diamond agreement for corporate and leisure customers to pre purchase flight time at fixed hourly rates on long range and ultra long range private jets the minimum purchase is 50 hours with no minimum annual use but the rates are not publicly disclosed these bespoke flights are guaranteed if booked at least 72 hours in advance the doha based airline noted that as a result of the covid 19 pandemic clients are looking for versatile high quality services from a financially secure operator looking ahead the demand for private jets may grow as travel restrictions are gradually lifted filling the gap before scheduled flights resume those who must travel urgently could choose the business jet option says mr lau from cirium there is also the moreish factor travellers who have used business jets for the first time could choose it again for future travels driven by the convenience privacy and peace of mind offered by business jets which they have experienced he suggests and

done deal south korea topped a straits times poll of countries that singaporeans would like the republic to have an air travel bubble with last october it was the favourite with 40 7 per cent in a

citizens including actress xenia tan to record their video responses to the kiwi messages and share experience of the country new zealand whose leadership won global praise for its handling of the

heart warming inspiring local stories during this time of fear and uncertainty presenting a respite from unending pandemic news brisbane's lone pine koala sanctuary set up live cams showing cuddly koalas in their habitat technology elevates armchair travel to new heights ms ho phang says a planet in lockdown has turned globetrotter ivan tan 35 into an armchair traveller pre pandemic the civil servant revelled in 10 trips a year but now he delves into virtual tours once or twice a week even at unearthly hours the free tours hosted by tourism boards and travel agencies included a western front battlefield tour in europe christmas markets in germany and elsewhere and coastal tottori in japan he won a bottle of wine last december when he went virtual sightseeing in western australia at a dynasty travel promotional gig online jaunts are an escape for the travel famished he reckons they are a reminder that there are places not yet explored it is for such travellers that tourism players keep their destinations alive through fancy outreach addressing suppressed wanderlust while positioning themselves for a burst in demand one day the ideal messaging layers inspiration with safety ms maria elena rossi marketing and promotion director at the italian tourist board highlights inspirational content for instance branding ravenna city which is celebrating the 700th anniversary of the poet dante's death but she also points out that rome's fiumicino airport became the first in the world to earn the desirable covid 19 five star airport rating from skytrax visit monaco while nurturing its luxury image highlighted its safety focus that led to a not so catastrophic summer season with hotel occupancy rates topping 90 per cent on certain days in july and august last year the travel industry is mindful of the new pandemic traveller says ms debbie flynn global travel practice leader at finn partners a new york brand building consultancy firm this emergent traveller will decide where to go this year based on factors never considered before from levels of covid cases to quarantine requirements costs will be weighted too this is impacted by new requirements like testing on departure and arrival she says and also the risk of staying longer if quarantined due to illness one bright spot is that travellers live in hope even if they have to start and stop plans this year a new tripadvisor report noted that nearly half 47 per cent of travellers surveyed globally say they are planning to travel overseas in 2021 the figure for singaporean travellers is higher at 61 per cent one in 10 singaporean respondents have already booked an international trip for this year dubai even as it pushes out sophisticated campaigns pictures itself almost in a post pandemic zone as it has been open to visitors since last july and its vaccination rates are high the last quarter of 2020 aimed at creating bookings since the destination is open and safe '' says mr issam kazim chief executive of dubai tourism many countries are still shuttered however so destination marketeers such as ms ho phang try creative tactics brandstory is recommending one destination that we are working

move to relocate to singapore and open yakiniquest in boat quay in 2014 but they had always wanted a space in orchard road and their dream came true in january when the restaurant moved to the fourth floor of mandarin gallery the new place is more spacious has four private rooms and can seat 64 diners there are two omakase courses for lunch priced at 88 and 128 a person for dinner the choices are between 138 and 188 the menus are planned by mr ishida and chosen to showcase different cuts of meat and ways of eating it for example i had grilled tongue eaten with chopped leeks a wagyu aburi sushi and sukiyaki each provides a unique experience for the palate i like fatty meat so my favourite cuts are the ribeye and rib intercostal but i appreciate that alternating them with leaner cuts that have more bite and flavour makes the meal more enjoyable a staff member does the grilling at the table to ensure nothing is overcooked the meal includes a salad chawanmushi and appetisers and ends with beef curry with rice or cold inaniwa noodle if that is not enough you can also add extra pieces like zabuton beef chuck with yam wasabi 16 or rib finger 42 there are also small bites such as japanese egg omelette with wagyu 14 and wagyu croquette 6 each where yakiniquest 04 08 mandarin gallery 333 orchard road mrt orchard somerset open noon to 3pm 5 30 to 10 30pm mondays to saturdays

camouflaged that i walked past it a few times without seeing it and ended up asking for directions from a hotel staff that is supposed to provide a talking point for this 11 seater sushi restaurant but i think it is unnecessary because the food is good enough to speak for itself taiga dining is named after chef taiga kanekuni who comes from kochi prefecture in japan's shikoku island he has more than 20 years' experience in japan before coming here to work as the head chef of sushi ayumu in mandarin gallery there are three omakase choices priced at 280 380 and 480 for lunch with the focus on edomae sushi the 280 option is not available for dinner the chef injects personal touches by using ingredients like pomelo and katsuo bonito from his home prefecture some items also come with caviar or arugula the result of his time working at an italian restaurant in tokyo the prices are on the high side compared with other sushi restaurants here especially for lunch when many of them offer a cheaper option below 200 so try the 280 lunch the first time and if you like it you can go back for the full works where taiga dining 01 03 regent singapore 1 cuscaden road mrt orchard open 11am to

harpersbazaarsg on instagram harpersbazaarsingapore on facebook the march 2022 issue is out on newsstands now anything new in fashion requires major disruption these days change is not simply coming from conglomerate backed brands which have the singular power that comes hand in hand with having a large pool of resources including channels of communication and a long and often rich history independent brands are gaining much strength and visibility from being united in numbers and through the communities they stand with telfar and pyer moss for example have set the bar not only with their designs but also the diversity they champion collina strada chromat and christian siriano have specifically designed for people with disabilities and highlighted how much fashion needs to consider their needs here however we round up the names that have not only changed fashion but are also setting the course for what is to come what is obvious now is that underdogs heading large fashion companies are at the top of their game take kering owned balenciaga which has kept the world on its toes under the creative direction of demna who recently elected to go by his first name only demna has erased the boundaries between haute couture and streetwear and completely upended what a fashion show or collaboration is today instead of a traditional show for spring summer 2022 he released a mini episode of the simpsons the show itself took place on the pre screening red carpet blurring the lines between attendees and models what's next the metaverse according to balenciaga right now the climax of interaction with a luxury brand is that you click 'like' or 'comment' or buy something i think we can get to the next level explained mr cedric charbit chief executive officer of the brand at the 2021 edition of voices the business of fashion's annual gathering in fact the executive envisions balenciaga as less of a brand and more of a platform where anything is possible and where innovation comes first a platform where the right conversations can happen it's why we can do couture in 2021 and fortnite in the same quarter speaking of universes prada which delves in cinema architecture and art among other things has significantly changed the digital communication game under mr lorenzo bertelli the son of miuccia prada and the company's chief executive officer patrizio bertelli who is being groomed to take over the reins there is no question that prada has changed fashion itself it is notorious for being esoteric and intellectual but it has become much more accessible and fun in its messaging it resonates with a new generation of highly savvy social media driven consumers each campaign of the pradaverse feels like a full fledged world travelling project with extensive ideation and participation its most recent show for spring summer 2022 staged in milan and shanghai and broadcast simultaneously side by side was a testament to a brand thinking fashion where its most interesting endeavours lie beyond clothing doing these shows simultaneously demonstrates a new possibility explained co creative director raf simons post show community is a vital idea drawing together people who share ideologies values and beliefs as simons says communities are integral to change and communities always need space dover street market's mr adrian joffe understood this when he founded the company which has become the space for pop up events internationally it changed the way people experience shopping and ultimately how products are created and marketed mr joffe's new project 3537 is a reversal of his original idea it is fundamentally a cultural centre where maybe the retail space will be part of the event rather than the event being part of the retail space he shared in an interview with business of fashion this more efficiently addresses the issues and themes that not only fashion but also society as a whole must tackle convinced that artists are a part of the essential first line of our collective reaction to the climate emergency 3537 is opening its doors to artists and thinkers bearing an ecological message from the protection of biodiversity to documenting climate related migrations said a statement it is no secret that fashion's endeavours in addressing climate change have mostly been labelled as greenwashing chloe under the creative direction of gabriela hearst however positions sustainability not as a fringe value the entirety of the brand has been restructured to place it at its core the clothes have taken a more crafty turn emphasising handcrafts and pre existing low impact material in fact its latest initiative is aptly named chloe craft with its range of products labelled with a spiral logo denoting that each one was completely handmade but the most effective change the brand has made is its social media language which reads and looks like a national geographic of sorts stunning intimate photography paired with captions of trivia and poems with a free form collection of images rather than extremely calculated postings the brand seems more like a living breathing organism that connects emotionally with its audience it all fits chloe became a certified b corporation last october meaning it meets both environmental and social sustainability standards for its spring summer 2022 collection for instance chloe worked with the kenyan non profit organisation ocean sole as well as akanjo a social enterprise in madagascar on the sourcing and production of its products it is important to note that consumers are enticed by off the grid marketing american singer frank ocean's homer launched last year benefited from using offline marketing reminiscent of the early 2000s a memorable well designed catalogue an artefact that harks back to the dawn of the millennium was attainable only if you were given one in the streets or went to the store it is now available only on ebay for upwards of us 1 000 s 1 365 similar to what balenciaga has done homer shows that luxury today is an obvious mix of high and low presented with novelty but more importantly nostalgia jewellery from homer shares the same price points as cartier though the aesthetics could not be more different homer's enamel jewellery starts at about 680 while its fine jewellery can go up to about 2 6 million there was also the homer x prada collaboration to cement its status as a name to watch in the luxury sphere prada rarely grants collaborations homer is shrouded in mystery leaving us to self decrypt its next move on the opposite end of ocean's approach is another celebrity brand changing the fashion game kim kardashian west's skims offering underwear loungewear and shapewear the brand churns out a constant flux of content and the stories are shared on the brand and the founder's personal social media accounts it is all about blurring the lines skims gained a lot of high fashion legitimacy when it was stocked at selfridges in london and galeries lafayette in paris and ultimately released its collaboration with fendi at this point it has built links to every major fashion capital both fendi and skims have a cultural power very different from each other but equally as strong says kim kardashian of the collaboration though competitors such as wolford and spanx have been around for decades longer skims successfully communicated that shapewear is capable of such a monumental range of sizes colours styles and prices setting the bar along the way for what fashion could be for the non fashion consumer who is now included there lies the common ground for a partnership with a brand such as fendi my fendi is about creating something for every woman every different shape and that's something at the

an iranian architect who was a pioneer in deploying recycled materials he gathered lovely rejects from the old city and a shipyard for the courtyard a hidden gem with a human scale and a beguiling contrast to the flashy architecture and malls that are constantly in the public eye i keep seeking other faces of dubai before my trip my hosts at dubai tourism say i can ask inconvenient questions at the sheikh mohammed centre for cultural understanding cultures ae set in a restored wind tower house the centre serves an emirati brunch in an air conditioned carpeted courtyard where foreign visitors loll on bedouin cushions as a host converses with us for an hour or so that is where i question ms farhayah salameh younis 26 a presenter who asserts that arabic women are not oppressed she makes independent choices she points out nothing in islam says i have to dress in black i can wear white maroon and pink just not in a see through fabric sheer black however is perfect as it is non revealing cool and flattering i don't have to worry about gaining weight she quips she takes all questions anything from emirati royalty social media savvy to what she does for fun shop do make up and sleep on dubai's competitive spirit she declares if new york and singapore can do it we can do it there's no 'impossible' on my previous trips to the united arab emirates qatar and oman i had stepped into museums where unfamiliar arabic culture came alive for me the displays often highly interactive and beautiful are clearly products of intelligent design and the deep pockets of the gulf nations dubai's new al shindagha museum alshindagha dubaiculture gov ae a complex of museums that is still opening in phases conveys the story of the emirate through multimedia experiences and artefacts the two immersive pavilions i pop into are dubai creek birth of a city and the perfume house together the two museums show how far the city has come from a fishing village and pearling centre to today's metropolis in the dubai creek pavilion i play an interactive game picking up passengers on a little virtual abra or an old time water taxi soon i am lost in time watching a multimedia show on the city's early years including the seafaring days and later a time of depression after japan's formidable pearl industry shredded dubai's humbler sector in the perfume house which highlights the scent history of the emirate i sniff bottles of fragrances such as amber and rose i scroll down an ipad to read about perfume in beauty rituals my dubai moment happens in an improbable orchard of steel and plastic trees festooned with light emitting diodes i have walked out to an upper veranda of the new intimate jameel arts centre jameelartscentre org which displays contemporary art when i spy the trees that remind me of the sci fi fantasy film avatar 2009 the veranda overlooks the dubai creek like a middle eastern sibling of the singapore river where the story of dubai began the trees are timed to light up when the sky gets darker but i am on a tight schedule so the staff gracious like other emiratis i meet flip the switches for me close to sunset a gentle light suffuses new and old dubai colouring both its over the top skyline and historic creek surprisingly another dubai moment takes place at one of its flashiest architectural feats at the dubai frame a gargantuan golden frame that rises into the sky i walk through immersive galleries that present the past present and future of dubai i step onto a skywalk 150m above the city which fascinates and terrifies me the glass turns transparent when i walk on it which induces a fear of falling after repeating the jaunt however the skywalking is normalised much like the way dubai's artifice grows on travellers i imagine even as we do a deeper dive beneath the sleek surfaces just like singapore is not the country portrayed in the crazy rich asians 2018 movie dubai is not all about crazy rich emiratis nuances abound in any society the metropolis is a hop away from relaxed beaches with turquoise water and city views i stop by several beaches where i experience the mash up that is dubai on kite beach i hear interlacing calls to prayers from several mosques as i enjoy a designer burger from the salt food truck find salt com at jbr beach with its chill cafes and roaring jet skis and waterfront condominiums women clad in bikinis or covered in abayas sit serenely in the same space it is a live and let live attitude where each woman has a right to be there while liberal dubai is not wholly representative of the diverse arab world it is still a whiff of the region and an easy stepping stone into the gulf states and dubai itself is never really what it seems intricately layered and often imaginative it is more than glitz and the intoxication of money the writer's trip was hosted by dubai tourism follow lee siew hua on twitter stsiewhua for food lovers dubai is a round the world culinary journey that never ends its food map girdles the globe with anything from the world's first masterchef the tv experience restaurant to luscious strawberries farmed in the desert with french technology high end indian fusion restaurants and hip food trucks have equal appeal in this city of crossroads and of course there is arabic coffee spiced with cardamom and saffron apart from low fat lattes in the uber cool cafes that saturate any urban terrain it is in this foodie wonderland that singaporean chef akmal anuar 37 has planted 3 fils 3fils com a casual restaurant serving asian inspired small plates once the head chef of modern european restaurant iggy's in singapore he sold his five room housing board flat to pursue his dreams in dubai his first move was zengo a latin asian concept which celebrity chef restaurateur richard sandoval opened in 2012 in collaboration with him then in late 2016 he opened 3 fils with two emirati dudes he seats our trio at his private chef's table we admire his dexterity and focus in conjuring up dishes with exquisite ingredients such as maguro from kagoshima palestinian olive oil chinese beluga caviar and peruvian white asparagus there is a poignant moment when the chef presents his emo fries so named because potatoes are cheap and there was not enough cash flow in the beginning the son of nasi padang hawker parents he is in a good place now he easily fills the 30 seats in the stylish interior and another 20 outdoors dining is a lifestyle for the sociable people of dubai he observes unlike 3 fils the masterchef the tv experience restaurant masterchefdxb com opened to much fanfare on april 30 its decor features the clock and brick wall of the blockbuster tv show watched by 300 million people globally the show is a quest for the best amateur cooks dubai is the first to host a masterchef restaurant the menu is stocked with creations by masterchef champions including 2008 britain winner james nathan's truffle and pea soup with parmesan galette best of all is the mystery box that head chef margarita vaamonde beggs 34 a venezuelan brings to our table i get to pick ingredients from the selection and my choices are sea bass jalapeno jerusalem artichoke and quail's egg she goes to work in the open concept kitchen while we sip cocktails mine is a singaporean orchid that blends refreshing gin starfruit and coriander syrup soon the chef returns with a sea bass encased in a paper parcel en papillote brightened with jalapeno and grilled lime on the side a poached quail egg nestles on a cloud of jerusalem artichoke puree she completes her spontaneous creation with a tomatillo sauce from her latino heritage the big seller is the mystery box she says not every restaurant is willing to put their chefs on the spot indian restaurants are a very visible presence in dubai just like the two million plus indian residents who make up about 30 per cent of the population tresind tresind com is a modernist indian restaurant that guests enjoy for its high end menu and theatre we are welcomed with scented smoke that rolls cloud like over our table the hints of lemon zest and musk calming us down a joyful prelude to a multi course excursion i delight in the playful concoctions of the young chefs the puri a deep fried round bread sold on streets is re interpreted as a tiny crisp shell served with a green pearl of coriander and tamarind juices a lemon tree bonsai is a botanical setting for lime sorbet kedgeree a comfort food of rice and lentils goes elaborate with a mirrored tray of 44 ingredients from peanut powder to pomegranate that are tossed into the pot one at a time fun prevails at the last exit lastexit ae en where food trucks look cheerily retro in primary colours and under fairy lights close to 11pm on a cool night we sip sweet milky karak chai a black tea with cardamom and evaporated milk that costs 10 dirham s 3 80 the spiced tea an indian import is so embedded in the dubai lifestyle now that grabbing a cuppa is called karaking dubai keeps its arabic coffee tradition alive however at the dubai coffee museum coffeemuseum ae set in the historic al fahidi district and elsewhere i drink lightly roasted coffee scented with cardamom and saffron arabs have long bonded over conversation and tiny cups of coffee sipped in between bites of dates the gahwa coffee custom is on unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity along with falconry serving coffee is an element of arabic hospitality which i also experience on a desert safari platinum heritage com it is romantic driving through the desert of super fine sand with wind drawn waves and fun riding a camel after watching a peregrine falcon show and letting the high speed predator named flux perch momentarily on my arm it is time for jaunty emirati dancing and a banquet i love the light soothing camel milk that accompanies lamb rice lentil soup and other hearty fare hearty is also the taste of affordable street food in dubai i especially like the shawarma or rotisserie grilled meat i choose chicken shawarma 9 dirham from a small shop in the blue collar satwa neighbourhood during a walking tour with arabian adventures arabian adventures com from the emirates group it is pleasant to sample street food in a city with an expensive reputation another surprise is to find strawberries grown in a climate controlled shipping container in the desert i taste the juicy fragrant strawberries in the avant garde sustainable city thesustainablecity ae a cluster of residences with biodome farms retail equestrian club and upcoming autism village that aim to be a zero net energy city we squeeze into the futuristic container that produces 5 000kg of strawberries a year from 1 000 plants its monthly water consumption is equivalent to what one villa uses a day strawberries in dubai that is the essence of the city that embraces the best and boldest the world offers i fly direct from singapore to dubai on emirates emirates com to get around in the city take a cab or use ride hailing apps uber and careem tips in the united arab emirates the weekend falls on friday and saturday malls remain open stretch the dollar with affordable quality instagram worthy stays such as zabeel house mini zabeelhouse com where rooms can be booked for under 100 a night casual dining spots include the new la mer beachfront lamerdubai ae en where burgers ice cream and world cuisines can be relished in a cool locale elsewhere look for hole in the wall joints that serve shawarma the flavour of the middle east similar to kebab the meat such as chicken or lamb is grilled on a vertical rotisserie families with children will enjoy dubai the safe family friendly destination has the indoor ski resort ski dubai skidxb com and many beaches with cafes and turquoise water theme parks abound centred on concepts ranging from lego to bollywood dubai is a city of change this is evident everywhere whether at the world's first masterchef the tv experience

savings from his pocket money and part time jobs for more than a decade he has been regularly putting aside up to 30 per cent of his monthly income from working in the medical device sector into investments you don t feel the effects of inflation until much later when you realise that prices of things have been going up while your money in the bank has stayed stagnant it might be the same amount but it s worth less now last month the ministry of trade and industry mti and monetary authority of singapore mas reported that singapore s core inflation which excludes accommodation and private transport costs had climbed to 2 4 per cent year on year in january the highest since september 2012 then there is the hike in goods and services tax gst from seven per cent to eight per cent from january 2023 followed by a further increase to nine per cent in 2024 announced in budget 2022 the ongoing russia ukraine conflict has also led to a steep rise in the price of oil bringing a sharp hike in petrol prices to about 3 a litre for most of last week according to data from the consumers association of singapore's pump price tracker fuel kaki regular prices fell below the 3 mark on thursday following a drop in the price of crude oil the knock on effects will impact the cost of everything from food to transport to utilities how did mr lim come to be so prescient i first learnt about the concept of inflation in junior college while studying economics he says however the real world implications of inflation didn t occur to me until i had a talk with a financial advisor who charted out the value of my money over time this shocked me into taking action investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation says mr lim and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire like mr lim more singaporeans are turning to investments to maintain or even grow the value of their dollar as a hedge against inflation the uob asean consumer sentiment study in november 2021 showed that 38 per cent of consumers surveyed were putting more money into investments in the past six months an increase of eight per cent from the year before investment firm franklin templeton s 2021 singapore next gen investor survey also found that investments were one of the top five expenses for singaporeans aged between 18 and 35 about 66 per cent indicated that their top goal for investing is financial freedom mr lim s investment journey was not easy when he first started i was completely new at investing my parents could not give me any advice because they themselves did not invest there were a million questions and no one to guide me he spent weeks researching before making his first investment i was extremely nervous because i only had a little bit of cash and i felt like i could not afford to make a mistake says mr lim who is now married and has no children his uncertainty then is still relevant for many today ms jacquelyn tan head of group personal financial services uob notes that while more people are keen to invest some hesitate because they believe they cannot afford to invest or have not set aside enough funds to do so another barrier is their perceived lack of knowledge or the perception that investing is complicated and only for the financially savvy she says but with technology this need not be so we have invested in digital solutions such as simpleinvest so we can empower our customers with different investment backgrounds objectives and risk appetites to invest in a way that suits them right at their fingertips says ms tan we have invested in digital solutions such as simpleinvest so we can empower our customers with different investment backgrounds objectives and risk appetites to invest in a way that suits them right at their fingertips the simpleinvest solution allows investors to invest with amounts starting from 100 they can find explanations of the benefits and risks fund performance and the fund managers strategy within the uob tmrw app close to 90 per cent of our customers using simpleinvest are new to unit trust products and we see them making monthly investments of 1 500 on average shares ms tan about a third of uob s simpleinvest customers have also started a regular investment plan investors would have to monitor their holdings and measure their performance even seasoned investors may find it challenging to navigate fast moving market cycles and digest the vast amount of information out there says ms tan with simpleinvest this is taken care of by professional asset managers from uob s asset management arm they evaluate the risks of the portfolios and adjust them accordingly as the tides shift seasoned investors can also choose their own unit trusts to invest in these unit trusts are curated by uob and are conveniently categorised into core and megatrend solutions core solutions tend to be less volatile and help to mitigate risk while megatrend solutions help investors to capture the market opportunity of long term trends that can shape the future economic landscape those who are new to investing should consider their risk appetite time horizon and investment objectives they should also practise dollar cost averaging a strategy that involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals says ms jacquelyn tan head of group personal financial services uob this is particularly useful because it helps you take a disciplined approach to investing instead of making impulsive or emotional decisions based on market conditions says ms tan a common recommendation is to invest about 20 per cent of one's salary each month to start investing newcomers can choose from three fund portfolios on simpleinvest to fit their needs these portfolios

        "content": "singapore the cpf basic retirement sum brs will be raised by 3 5 per cent a year for the next five cohorts turning 55 from 2023 to 2027 finance minister lawrence wong said in the budget speech last friday feb 18 that this is to provide central provident fund cpf members higher monthly payouts in their retirement years here are answers to some questions you may have about the brs it is the amount you should set aside in your retirement account when you turn 55 so that you can receive a monthly sum that the government believes will cover your basic living expenses in retirement assuming you do not need to pay rent cpf members receive lifelong monthly payouts through the cpf life scheme after they reach the eligible age currently 65 for those born from 1954 under the scheme a member's payouts depend on how much is saved in his retirement account when he joins cpf life any time between the ages of 65 and 70 the savings are used as a premium to buy an annuity which is a financial product that grows one's savings to provide regular payouts the brs for members turning 55 this year is 96 000 this translates into monthly payouts of about 790 to 850 in retirement if payouts start at 65 under the cpf life standard plan there are three types of cpf life plans escalating standard and basic with different payout structures the full retirement sum is two times the brs while the enhanced retirement sum is three times the brs when a member turns 55 savings from his special and ordinary accounts up to the full retirement sum will be transferred into his newly created retirement account for cpf members turning 55 this year setting aside the full retirement sum of 192 000 will result in lifelong payouts of around 1 470 to 1 570 each month if payouts start at 65 under the cpf life standard plan this payout level is targeted at people who do not own a property and thus may need to pay rent while retired the maximum amount of savings a cpf member can use for the cpf life scheme is the enhanced retirement sum plus any accumulated interest in his retirement account for cpf members turning 55 this year setting aside the enhanced retirement sum of 288 000 will result in lifelong payouts of around 2 140 to 2 300 each month if payouts start at 65 under the cpf life standard plan for each successive cohort of members turning 55 cpf life payouts need to be higher to account for long term inflation and a rising standard of living and the brs increases correspondingly said the manpower ministry on its website the brs for each cohort is calculated such that the monthly cpf life payout a member will receive is based on the expected spending needs in 10 years' time for retirees in the lower middle spending range according to the latest household expenditure survey it assumes the member owns a home that can last him until age 95 and does not need to pay rent in retirement using the higher brs the payouts for men turning 55 in 2027 on the cpf life standard plan will be close to 1 000 a month when they turn 65 in comparison men turning 55 in 2022 would get brs payouts of about 850 a month when the concept of the brs was introduced by the cpf advisory panel in 2015 the panel recommended that it be increased by 3 per cent each year for members who turn 55 between 2017 and 2020 as a gauge increases in the minimum sum which was the benchmark used before the brs ranged from 3 9 per cent to 10 4 per cent between july 2008 and july 2015 during the unity budget statement in 2020 deputy prime minister heng swee keat said that the brs would be raised by 3 per cent each year for members turning 55 between 2021 and 2022 those turning 50 to 54 this year they turn 55 in 2023 to 2027 are covered by this round of changes according to government data portal data gov sg around 225 410 active cpf members were over 45 years old and up to 50 years old in 2018 meaning they will turn 55 between 2023 and 2027 you do not have to top up your cpf accounts with cash or sell your property but you will have lower cpf life payouts as the premium used to buy the annuity will be smaller you can withdraw 5 000 of your special and ordinary account savings or all of your savings if your balances in those accounts total less than 5 000 from age 55 even if you do not meet your brs manpower minister tan see leng said in a facebook post last friday after the budget speech that about eight in 10 active cpf members aged 55 in 2027 are expected to have at least the brs he did not say how big this group is projected to be if you want to increase your savings you or your loved ones can top up your special account sa if you are below 55 or retirement account ra if you are 55 and above the government will also match every dollar of cash top ups made to the retirement accounts of eligible members up to 600 a year this is under the matched retirement savings scheme launched last year which will first run for five years dr tan said in his facebook post that there are no changes to cpf withdrawal rules this means that besides being able to withdraw up to 5 000 from your special and ordinary account savings from age 55 unconditionally you can withdraw any further amount from these accounts from age 55 as long as you have the full retirement sum in your retirement account you must draw down your special account balance first before drawing from your ordinary account you can also withdraw savings from your retirement account from age 55 as long as you leave your brs there if you own a property that can last you up to age 95 if you are turning 65 from next year onwards you can withdraw up to 20 per cent of your retirement account savings as at age 65 in a lump sum join st's telegram channel here and get

        "content": "singapore singapore's labour market recovery is expected to be sustained this year as business activities continue to pick up although this could be affected by rising uncertainty in the global economic outlook amid the ongoing russia ukraine conflict the pace of recovery may be more gradual as most significant improvements were already made last year the 2021 labour market report by the ministry of manpower mom on monday march 14 showed domestically the outlook is likely to be uneven across sectors last year total employment excluding migrant domestic workers rebounded by 41 400 after a sharp contraction of 166 600 in 2020 this was due to stronger resident employment growth which rose by 71 300 and more than offset the non resident employment decline of 30 000 the ministry highlighted in the report on monday in the fourth quarter alone total employment went up substantially by 47 900 despite the omicron outbreak the number of non resident workers employed grew for the first time in two years with the gradual easing of covid 19 border curbs on the inflow of foreign labour mom s data showed resident employment trends were mixed while employment grew in sectors such as information and communications health and social services professional services administrative and support services and financial services it fell moderately in accommodation air transport and supporting services and arts entertainment and recreation due to tight travel restrictions for the most part of the year meanwhile non resident employment declined in all sectors except for construction which was boosted by an increase in the fourth quarter with easing border restrictions this decline was due to decreases in the number of employment pass holders by 15 300 and s pass holders by 12 200 the number of work permit and other work pass holders also fell but by a smaller extent of 2 400 the unemployment situation also improved the overall rate fell to 2 7 per cent last year from 3 per cent in 2020 the resident unemployment rate which covers singapore citizens and permanent residents declined to 3 5 per cent from 4 1 per cent previously among citizens this was 3 7 per cent down from 4 2 per cent the unemployment rates in january this year were around those seen in december 2019 according to the report however the average long term unemployment rate among residents which accounts for workers who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more remained elevated at 1 per cent compared with pre covid 19 levels of about 0 7 per cent this was due to structural mismatches that tend to take longer to dissipate mom explained on the retrenchment front there was a significant decline from a high of 26 110 in 2020 to 8 020 last year below pre covid 19 levels a higher proportion of retrenched residents were able to secure employment the annual re entry rate among retrenched residents rose from 62 per cent in 2020 to 66 per cent last year a six year high at the same time hiring and job vacancies have gone up the seasonally adjusted recruitment rate trended higher to 2 5 per cent in the fourth quarter a rate last seen in 2014 the resignation rate also held steady over the quarter at 1 7 per cent slightly below the typical pre covid 19 rate outgoing permanent secretary for manpower aubeck kam said we are not seeing any overall uptick in resignation rates there are of course some sector variants but nothing to suggest that there is anything of concern on that front overall the labour market remained tight with the seasonally adjusted number of job vacancies rising further to 117 100 in december last year the high number of job openings was driven in part by travel restrictions impacting the inflow of migrant workers highlighted the report however with the gradual easing of these restrictions mom expects non resident workforce numbers to improve this year and job vacancies in sectors with heavier reliance on migrant workers to abate this year the outlook for the various sectors will continue to be uneven barring a sharp slowdown in the global economy outward oriented sectors are expected to continue seeing positive growth the information and communications and financial and insurance services in particular can expect healthy growth due to robust demand for it and digital solutions and credit and payment processing services said mom this should provide sustained labour demand in these sectors consumer facing sectors such as food and beverage services and retail trade are projected to benefit from the easing of covid 19 measures as more workers will be needed for the pickup in business activities on the other hand recovery for the tourism and aviation related sectors is expected to be slow on account of the gradual loosening of travel restrictions globally and the nascent recovery in global travel demand said mom employment levels in these sectors may take longer to return to pre covid 19 levels manpower minister tan see leng said he is cautiously optimistic that the labour market will maintain its recovery trajectory despite the increased downside risks in a facebook post on monday dr tan said providing targeted assistance to help businesses and workers remains a key priority for his ministry we will do more to uplift and strengthen support for vulnerable and mature workers he added mr patrick tay assistant secretary general of the national trades union congress said employers will need to brace for a tight labour market by looking for ways to redesign jobs and encourage digitalisation to keep pace with the developments workers too will need to embrace lifelong learning to pick up fresh skills and stay relevant for new or transformed jobs while being resilient to

of home affairs mha civilian officers in the home affairs senior executive hase scheme too get to advance their careers and deepen their expertise through many developmental opportunities as part of the scheme hase officers are able to experience different job roles across the home team to gain exposure and develop a breadth of knowledge and skills and as they progress they can choose to deepen knowledge in their domains of interest we meet two hase officers who share their player profiles and how mha has enabled them to up their career game character backstory jonas has played multiple roles as a talk show host a programmer a change champion and even a party planner since he started his mha career in the finance transformation office in 2018 now a senior manager with the human resource policy compensation hrpc team in the human resource division jonas is on a mission to formulate and implement hr policies to improve the lifelong employability of uniformed officers who retire at a relatively young age he finds the work meaningful and fulfilling and loves that his bosses encourage officers to challenge the status quo and explore new ideas our challenge is to sail into uncharted waters to discover and create new career pathways for these retiring officers i enjoy knocking on the doors of potential partners and employers learning from each engagement even if unsuccessful and eventually making some breakthroughs bonus xp as part of jonas s earlier stint in the finance transformation office he had a thrilling experience co hosting the good morning finance show talk show this was part of the change management efforts to leverage technology to improve processes within the finance community apart from hosting events he was also part of the team that programmed an automation bot from scratch this bot is able to recommend personalised training interventions for finance officers based on their competencies this innovation supports the professional development of finance officers and saves the finance team a whopping 130 man hours per year level up within three years jonas has received many development opportunities at the ministry which has allowed him to constantly challenge himself to try out new things the hase scheme exposes us to a wide range of portfolios within mha for myself i chose to be posted to hr as i wanted to develop my skill sets in policy and hr work both of which i was unfamiliar with thankfully i have very nurturing and supportive bosses who have guided me and encouraged me to attend courses to adapt to this major portfolio change he explains character backstory nine years ago gwendolyn wong started her career with the home team as a correctional rehabilitation specialist with the singapore prison service sps where she conducted psychology based correctional programmes to support offenders in their rehabilitation journey following that she was posted to sps s strategic planning division where she was involved in developing its transformation plan which includes leveraging technology to enhance operational effectiveness and to expand rehabilitation beyond the confines of prisons having had a taste of strategic planning work and enjoying it tremendously gwendolyn subsequently took on a role at the planning organisation division at mha headquarters where she was involved in innovation and futures thinking work to support the wider home team transformation efforts level up this year a new maintenance of racial harmony act will be introduced to encourage moderation and tolerance between different racial groups in singapore one of the brains behind this is gwendolyn who is now a senior manager at mha s policy development division handling policies relating to singapore s safety and security specifically social cohesion racial and religious harmony and politics matters whether it s in rehabilitation supporting the home team s transformation or ensuring social cohesion being part of the home team has given me the opportunity to make a real difference in keeping singapore safe and secure things get intense during a crisis especially one as unprecedented as the covid 19 pandemic with its many moving parts new scientific discoveries and constant updates on the various protocols ever wonder how the various ministries and agencies in singapore have kept a strong united front and coordinated crisis management measures for the past two years this is in large part thanks to the sustained efforts of the homefront crisis executive group hceg chaired by the permanent secretary at the ministry of home affairs mr pang kin keong which supports the ministerial task force and coordinates the whole of government response to the outbreak gwendolyn was also part of the hceg secretariat team which supported the government s covid 19 operations in 2020 she was tasked to liaise with various agencies such as the ministry of education ministry of manpower ministry of social and family development and the immigration and checkpoints authority to ensure that work processes and initiatives were aligned though challenging gwendolyn sees it as a labour of love for her country

savings from his pocket money and part time jobs for more than a decade he has been regularly putting aside up to 30 per cent of his monthly income from working in the medical device sector into investments you don t feel the effects of inflation until much later when you realise that prices of things have been going up while your money in the bank has stayed stagnant it might be the same amount but it s worth less now last month the ministry of trade and industry mti and monetary authority of singapore mas reported that singapore s core inflation which excludes accommodation and private transport costs had climbed to 2 4 per cent year on year in january the highest since september 2012 then there is the hike in goods and services tax gst from seven per cent to eight per cent from january 2023 followed by a further increase to nine per cent in 2024 announced in budget 2022 the ongoing russia ukraine conflict has also led to a steep rise in the price of oil bringing a sharp hike in petrol prices to about 3 a litre for most of last week according to data from the consumers association of singapore's pump price tracker fuel kaki regular prices fell below the 3 mark on thursday following a drop in the price of crude oil the knock on effects will impact the cost of everything from food to transport to utilities how did mr lim come to be so prescient i first learnt about the concept of inflation in junior college while studying economics he says however the real world implications of inflation didn t occur to me until i had a talk with a financial advisor who charted out the value of my money over time this shocked me into taking action investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation says mr lim and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire like mr lim more singaporeans are turning to investments to maintain or even grow the value of their dollar as a hedge against inflation the uob asean consumer sentiment study in november 2021 showed that 38 per cent of consumers surveyed were putting more money into investments in the past six months an increase of eight per cent from the year before investment firm franklin templeton s 2021 singapore next gen investor survey also found that investments were one of the top five expenses for singaporeans aged between 18 and 35 about 66 per cent indicated that their top goal for investing is financial freedom mr lim s investment journey was not easy when he first started i was completely new at investing my parents could not give me any advice because they themselves did not invest there were a million questions and no one to guide me he spent weeks researching before making his first investment i was extremely nervous because i only had a little bit of cash and i felt like i could not afford to make a mistake says mr lim who is now married and has no children his uncertainty then is still relevant for many today ms jacquelyn tan head of group personal financial services uob notes that while more people are keen to invest some hesitate because they believe they cannot afford to invest or have not set aside enough funds to do so another barrier is their perceived lack of knowledge or the perception that investing is complicated and only for the financially savvy she says but with technology this need not be so we have invested in digital solutions such as simpleinvest so we can empower our customers with different investment backgrounds objectives and risk appetites to invest in a way that suits them right at their fingertips says ms tan we have invested in digital solutions such as simpleinvest so we can empower our customers with different investment backgrounds objectives and risk appetites to invest in a way that suits them right at their fingertips the simpleinvest solution allows investors to invest with amounts starting from 100 they can find explanations of the benefits and risks fund performance and the fund managers strategy within the uob tmrw app close to 90 per cent of our customers using simpleinvest are new to unit trust products and we see them making monthly investments of 1 500 on average shares ms tan about a third of uob s simpleinvest customers have also started a regular investment plan investors would have to monitor their holdings and measure their performance even seasoned investors may find it challenging to navigate fast moving market cycles and digest the vast amount of information out there says ms tan with simpleinvest this is taken care of by professional asset managers from uob s asset management arm they evaluate the risks of the portfolios and adjust them accordingly as the tides shift seasoned investors can also choose their own unit trusts to invest in these unit trusts are curated by uob and are conveniently categorised into core and megatrend solutions core solutions tend to be less volatile and help to mitigate risk while megatrend solutions help investors to capture the market opportunity of long term trends that can shape the future economic landscape those who are new to investing should consider their risk appetite time horizon and investment objectives they should also practise dollar cost averaging a strategy that involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals says ms jacquelyn tan head of group personal financial services uob this is particularly useful because it helps you take a disciplined approach to investing instead of making impulsive or emotional decisions based on market conditions says ms tan a common recommendation is to invest about 20 per cent of one's salary each month to start investing newcomers can choose from three fund portfolios on simpleinvest to fit their needs these portfolios

        "content": "singapore a committee has been reconvened to address concerns that businesses could use the goods and services tax gst as a cover to raise prices the 13 member committee against profiteering cap will look into feedback on unjustified price increases of essential products and services and focus on daily items commonly consumed or used by singaporean households such as eggs and chicken chaired by minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling the committee held its first meeting on wednesday march 16 its other members include representatives from different industries grassroots organisations and mps the cap will keep a very close watch on the prices of our essential goods and services daily necessities and groceries ms low told reporters after the meeting the committee will review and investigate feedback on unjustified price increases that use gst as a reason and may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer on the pretext of the gst increase she added finance minister lawrence wong had announced that the committee would be formed during his budget speech in february when he set out how singapore's gst rate will increase from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in two stages by one percentage point each time on jan 1 2023 and jan 1 2024 the committee was first set up in 1994 the year gst was first introduced and reconvened during previous rounds of gst increases in 2003 and 2007 like before the reconvened committee will guard against profiteering on essential food items such as eggs chicken and vegetables and meals from hawker centres and coffee shops as well as non food essentials like household products ms low said that the reason why the committee is set up about nine months before the gst hike is to assure members of the public that we will take a whole of government approach in fact take a whole of society approach to look into egregious cases unjustified price increase using the gst increase as a reason and that is a very important signal at the same time she noted that we are in a very complex situation compared with 2007 as businesses are facing cost pressures and some sectors are facing more severe pressure than other sectors due to the nature of their sector ms low said that the ministry of trade and industry will spare no efforts to support those sectors and the companies whether it is retail or food and beverages citing the support rolled out in budget 2022 such as the 70 million food services and retail business revitalisation package and the small business recovery grant with the help of businesses and members of the public we will be able to uphold healthy market competition for the benefit of the market and society she added on how the committee is going to decide the perimeters of whether a business is justified in raising its prices ms low said in general our businesses are honest and transparent in their pricing and they should continue to do so cap's role is to strengthen transparency in pricing to enable free market competition to function as it should she added so genuine and honest businesses have nothing to worry about she said asked how the essential items will be chosen ms low noted that the singapore department of statistics compiles the consumer price index based on a basket of goods and services so we are using that mechanism to monitor closely the prices of our essential goods and services groceries and daily necessities she said ms low noted that the committee received about 200 pieces of feedback from the public between 2007 and 2009 about 90 per cent of them were related to the food and beverage and retail sectors back then cap would work with partners like the people's association pa and the consumers association of singapore case to look into public feedback about price hikes she noted in many of the cases the merchants actually agreed to explain why it's necessary for them to make the price adjustment and in some cases the merchants and the hawkers actually deferred the price increase she added out of the 200 feedback ms low said the cap made public one case in 2007 a student care centre had been reprimanded for excessive fee increase the centre which was not named had announced to parents in its newsletter that due to the gst hike from 5 per cent to 7 per cent it would be raising its fees from 270 to 280 across its branches the 10 difference was nearly twice the additional amount of 5 40 that parents had to pay for the gst hike on whether there is a timeframe for the cap to take action or conduct further investigations after a feedback has been filed ms low said it could vary depending on the feedback some members of the committee said they are glad to be part of the cap and to keep a lookout for consumers' interest mr hong poh hin vice chairman of the foochow coffee restaurant and bar merchants association which represents more than 400 coffee shops said businesses can adjust their prices but when they adjust their prices they must be transparent it can't be that because the gst goes up by 1 per cent then they increase their prices by a lot said mr hong meanwhile radin mas mp and case president melvin yong said case is happy to support the national effort to address consumers' concerns of profiteering and unjustified price increases under the cover of gst we are mindful that some businesses may take this opportunity to raise prices without justification we must therefore send a strong signal that profiteering and unjustified price increases disguised under the pretext of gst cannot be tolerated he said singapore retailers association president r dhinakaran said that educating businesses on cap's role will be done as this can help prevent profiteering in this way firms will not do any of the profiteering because of the gst because they know the gst is tax neutral that means what they collect from the consumers they will have to pay to iras inland revenue authority of singapore he said consumers told the straits times that they welcomed the reconvening of the committee to ensure that their interests are taken care of administrative manager siti ali 40 said singaporeans have to carry the impact when the gst hike takes place in the next two years by having this committee they will help in becoming like a gatekeeper to strike a balance between understanding the needs of consumers and businesses she said members of the public who wish to report unjustified price hikes using the gst increase as an excuse can do so at this website from april 1

lessors of planes stuck in russia since the onset of sanctions have warned insurers of possible claims to come if the jets are not returned insurers meanwhile are cancelling some policies including for war risk and may challenge claims on coverage still in force industry participants said the magnitude of potential loss here is staggering said mr garrett hanrahan global head of aviation and space for insurance broker marsh a unit of marsh mclennan this could potentially be the biggest aviation insurance loss in market history both sides are trying to improve their positions after president vladimir putin allowed russian airlines to keep aircraft until the end of their lease terms and re register them in the country leasing firms seeking to repossess planes have until march 28 to cancel contracts under european union sanctions and broader banking prohibitions as the focus shifts to the insurance market providers of coverage are trying to avoid being overloaded with claims the stand off threatens firms up and down the insurance market food chain foreign lessors had 509 aircraft rented to russian operators as at march 16 according to aviation consultant iba that is 14 planes less than the 523 plane tally on march 10 some of the 14 planes were outside russia when sanctions were imposed and have since been returned to lessors iba said dublin based aercap holdings the world's biggest leasing firm had 142 of the original total followed by smbc aviation capital with 35 as at march 10 though it remains unclear exactly how many of the leased planes remain in russia lloyd's of london provides the vast majority of aviation coverage according to sources familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information representatives for aercap and smbc aviation declined to comment on whether they had sent any notices of claims lloyd's of london declined to comment on the market's exposure to potential claims aercap will comply with eu sanctions it said late last month smbc aviation terminated all its russian leases and had aircraft in russia with a net book value of us 1 7 billion s 2 3 billion as at february the financial times reported on thursday mar 17 that lloyd's of london is expecting a significant but manageable overall loss with a final bill between us 1 billion and us 4 billion after reinsurance pays out citing a source familiar with the matter the exchange did not respond to a request for comment about the estimate at a jpmorgan chase co conference on wednesday air lease corp chairman steven udvar hazy said russia's action to hold onto aircraft that had their leases cancelled could actually help lessors with their insurance claims it demonstrates the intent to confiscate which is i think a critical aspect of our war risk insurance he said analysts at credit suisse group said in a note on thursday that there will be significant debate over whether primary insurance coverage will be effective but secondary coverage held by lessors which are contracts with the insurance company and unrelated to russian entities are likely to remain effective the analysts led by mr moshe orenbuch said primary insurers receiving notices of possible claims may also turn to their reinsurers for payouts mr james healy pratt an aviation lawyer and partner at keystone law in london said legal battles may be looming as firms squabble over what is covered and what is not the issue with the leased planes in russia will be a very complex one as countries don't normally seize large fleets of aircraft he said whatever happens the lessors will have to take a massive write down in the value of their assets and so far we haven't seen any sec securities and exchange commission filings from the lessors mr healy pratt pointed to iraq's invasion of kuwait in 1990 where iraqi forces seized a number of commercial aircraft fuelling about two decades of litigation while not exactly parallel the scale of the challenge ahead will be massive and i expect years of litigation between lessors insurers and underwriters about who pays the bill he said the contentious situation has already spurred at least one lawsuit singapore based lessor boc aviation boca sued russia's airbridgecargo airlines this week over a boeing plane currently in hong kong boc aviation alleges that cancellation of a reinsurance policy triggered a default under their lease agreement allowing for repossession of the jet as a result of the cancelled and invalidated insurance boca terminated the leasing of the aircraft and exercised its contractual right to demand the immediate return of the aircraft with all necessary records boca alleges in the lawsuit airbridge however is refusing to recognise the termination of leasing of the aircraft and is refusing to return the records it is instead demanding that boca authorise the aircraft to be flown from hong kong to russia the insurance industry's exposure is yet to be determined according to marsh's mr hanrahan if leasing companies can successfully retrieve all of their aircraft from russia any claims may go away the sources familiar with the matter said lloyd's of london's dominance in the market could also dissuade claims as holders with cancelled policies refrain from suing the main provider of insurance coverage for fear of being shut out lloyd's of

economy more than 4 000 miles away in the indian ocean hit by soaring oil import costs and a dip in tourism revenue sri lanka is racing to avert a default amid dwindling foreign exchange holdings with inflation already at 15 per cent the worst in asia the conflict is only making it harder for the tropical island located off the southern tip of india fuel shortages and blackouts lasting as long as seven hours have become daily routine while the wait gets longer at gas stations where prices surged almost 50 per cent this month the authorities are struggling to contain the crisis they have raised interest rates devalued the local currency and placed curbs on non essential imports but with a meagre us 2 billion in forex reserves and us 7 billion in debt payments due this year the battle is turning uphill the government this week finally abandoned its reluctance to seek help from the international monetary fund imf and president gotabaya rajapaksa pledged to fulfill sri lanka's obligations the russia ukraine conflict could not have come at a worse time for sri lanka which is still recovering from a brutal 30 year ethnic strife that ended in 2009 the south asian country has sought to revive growth since spending millions on tourism infrastructure until the pandemic dealt a blow to its plans the crisis also showed how russia's war is putting some of the fragile developing economies at risk and imperilling decades of efforts to lift millions out of poverty in south asia other vulnerable countries include bangladesh maldives nepal and pakistan said bloomberg economics economist ankur shukla though direct trade and financial linkages with russia and ukraine are limited the price and supply shocks are powerful he wrote in a note on march 9 with a population of about 22 million sri lanka is a net importer of goods from medicine to fuel in december last year petroleum products accounted for about 20 per cent of inbound shipments and the cost jumped 88 per cent from a year earlier the increase in oil prices this year is adding to the burden the country has also been paying off external debt it piled on to help rebuild an economy scarred by the bloody civil war between the majority buddhist sinhalese and a tamil minority that is predominantly hindu that has been draining its forex reserves another pain point is tourism revenue about 30 per cent of visitors this year were from russia ukraine poland and belarus and the war is threatening to turn off that tap sri lanka earned us 3 6 billion from tourism in 2019 before the pandemic slashed that to less than a fifth two years later official data showed the central government's foreign owned debt stood at us 32 billion as at last november optimism that the government will soon manage to reach a deal with the imf has already spurred a rally in the country's dollar bonds an offshore bond due 2030 rallied to 49 cents to the dollar from a record low of 38 9 cents on march 9 while one year default probability has dropped to 18 2 per cent from as much as 31 3 per cent in late december last year according to data compiled by bloomberg the nation's international bonds need to be restructured by july as sri lanka does not have the necessary resources to pay the us 1 billion due that month citigroup said in a february note besides raising borrowing costs and devaluing the rupee central bank governor ajith nivard cabraal also urged restrictions on non essential imports of around 300 items from electronic appliances to apples and increases in fuel prices and power tariffs the government seems to be reacting positively and that would help steer the economy to calmer waters in this time of unprecedented global challenges mr cabraal said by phone last week yet for ordinary sri lankans the pain is real civic groups have held vigils highlighting rising costs while the main opposition party organised a mass rally in the capital city of colombo on march 15 demanding the resignation of president rajapaksa the protests pose no immediate threat to his government which commands almost two thirds majority in parliament mr sugath chaminda 44 said he spent about 10 hours to refuel his auto rickshaw after being turned away by numerous gas pumps that had run dry he then spent more time hunting for a cylinder of cooking gas which was also in short supply some of the inflation surge is

savings from his pocket money and part time jobs for more than a decade he has been regularly putting aside up to 30 per cent of his monthly income from working in the medical device sector into investments you don t feel the effects of inflation until much later when you realise that prices of things have been going up while your money in the bank has stayed stagnant it might be the same amount but it s worth less now last month the ministry of trade and industry mti and monetary authority of singapore mas reported that singapore s core inflation which excludes accommodation and private transport costs had climbed to 2 4 per cent year on year in january the highest since september 2012 then there is the hike in goods and services tax gst from seven per cent to eight per cent from january 2023 followed by a further increase to nine per cent in 2024 announced in budget 2022 the ongoing russia ukraine conflict has also led to a steep rise in the price of oil bringing a sharp hike in petrol prices to about 3 a litre for most of last week according to data from the consumers association of singapore's pump price tracker fuel kaki regular prices fell below the 3 mark on thursday following a drop in the price of crude oil the knock on effects will impact the cost of everything from food to transport to utilities how did mr lim come to be so prescient i first learnt about the concept of inflation in junior college while studying economics he says however the real world implications of inflation didn t occur to me until i had a talk with a financial advisor who charted out the value of my money over time this shocked me into taking action investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation says mr lim and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire investing helps me to at least keep ahead of inflation and in the future hopefully my investments will have grown enough to let me live comfortably when i retire like mr lim more singaporeans are turning to investments to maintain or even grow the value of their dollar as a hedge against inflation the uob asean consumer sentiment study in november 2021 showed that 38 per cent of consumers surveyed were putting more money into investments in the past six months an increase of eight per cent from the year before investment firm franklin templeton s 2021 singapore next gen investor survey also found that investments were one of the top five expenses for singaporeans aged between 18 and 35 about 66 per cent indicated that their top goal for investing is financial freedom mr lim s investment journey was not easy when he first started i was completely new at investing my parents could not give me any advice because they themselves did not invest there were a million questions and no one to guide me he spent weeks researching before making his first investment i was extremely nervous because i only had a little bit of cash and i felt like i could not afford to make a mistake says mr lim who is now married and has no children his uncertainty then is still relevant for many today ms jacquelyn tan head of group personal financial services uob notes that while more people are keen to invest some hesitate because they believe they cannot afford to invest or have not set aside enough funds to do so another barrier is their perceived lack of knowledge or the perception that investing is complicated and only for the financially savvy she says but with technology this need not be so we have invested in digital solutions such as simpleinvest so we can empower our customers with different investment backgrounds objectives and risk appetites to invest in a way that suits them right at their fingertips

regulation according to the co founder of the country's most famous crypto start up the brain drain is absolutely crazy mr sandeep nailwal whose polygon operates the biggest so called layer 2 protocol for the ethereum blockchain system said in an interview from dubai india with an estimated 15 million active crypto users has been stuck in regulatory limbo since the supreme court in 2020 overturned a central bank ban on digital tokens the government this year unveiled a tax on crypto transactions without formally declaring that it would not ban trading a move that became emblematic of the confusion on tuesday march 15 finance minister nirmala sitharaman said the government has yet to make a final call on whether to ban virtual coins or regulate them at the same time she acknowledged the industry's potential as a source of tax income the government imposes a 30 per cent tax on digital coin transactions mr nailwal who co founded polygon in 2017 relocated to dubai two years ago the emirate is aspiring to be a crypto hub for the middle east just as it is for traditional financial services and on wednesday it adopted a law for regulating digital assets polygon's eponymous protocol is used by developers to make ethereum transactions cheaper and faster it has some 7 000 decentralised apps or dapps more than 130 million unique users and handles over three million daily transactions last month polygon raised us 450 million s 611 5 million by selling its matic token to investors led by sequoia capital india i want to live in india and promote the web3 ecosystem the 34 year old said but overall the way the regulatory uncertainty is there and how big polygon has become it doesn't make sense for us or for any team to expose their protocols to local risks on the face of it india has the potential to be a crypto powerhouse the population of 1 4 billion people skews young with a growing well educated middle class that combined with a less developed traditional financial system has led to the world's second highest crypto adoption rate behind vietnam according to blockchain research firm chainalysis overall crypto transactions jumped 641 per cent between july 2020 and june last year chainalysis said in an october report china the only country with a larger population last year declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal governments around the world have long grappled with the need to tame the worst excesses of an industry beset by speculation fraud and hacking incidents while at the same time harnessing its explosive growth and potential for innovation countries from singapore to the united states are now moving toward a more structured approach to regulating the sector investors and entrepreneurs around the world have clamoured for more clarity bitcoin surged as much as 11 per cent on thursday as word got out of an impending executive order from us president joe biden to coordinate the government's approach to crypto even as indians embrace digital assets and the government warms to the potential for tax revenue the industry still faces determined opposition from the central bank and while it is not uncommon for central banks to express scepticism towards crypto the reserve bank of india's criticism has been particularly withering governor shaktikanta das last month compared the asset class unfavourably to the 17th century dutch tulip market bubble a few days later his deputy said cryptocurrencies are akin to ponzi schemes threaten financial stability and should be banned mr edul patel the co founder of mudrex an automated digital asset trading platform backed by y combinator chose to set up his company in the us in 2019 after the central bank cut off crypto related businesses from india's payment network the central bank's move was later reversed by the supreme court right now many indian crypto companies developers and founders are trying to move to places like dubai mr patel said in an interview one selling point for dubai is its sandbox approach something india lacks for crypto he said governments often use so called sandbox set ups as a testing ground for promising but unproven financial

        "content": "beijing bloomberg the chinese authorities are considering requiring tencent holdings to include wechat pay in a newly created financial holding company part of an overhaul that may necessitate a new licence for the ubiquitous mobile payments service according to people familiar with the matter the potential move would present a fresh hurdle for tencent which along with other internet firms was told in 2021 to cordon off financial services from its main business similar to requirements imposed on billionaire jack ma's ant group tencent needs to fold its banking securities insurance and credit scoring services into a financial holding company that can be regulated like a traditional bank the people said regulators are now weighing whether wechat pay should be included in that holding company and operate separately from the main social media arm the people said asking not to be named discussing private deliberations while investors have long anticipated the financial services overhaul details of how that impacts wechat pay which handles billions of dollars daily but is a transactional platform rather than a lender have until now proven elusive including wechat pay in the financial entity adds a new layer of uncertainty to the restructuring because it is an integral feature of the wechat super app used by a billion plus people relying on backend support from different divisions any move that reduces the convenience of the service in tencent's mobile offerings risks chipping away at the one stop shop appeal that turned the chinese firm into one of the world's most valuable companies it might also revive investor angst about beijing's crackdown on technology companies speculation that the nearly two year campaign is nearing an end has helped stocks including tencent's rebound from multi year lows this week in addition having wechat pay in the financial holding company would subject the service and the vast reams of user data it generates daily to the direct scrutiny of new regulatory bodies like the central bank with uncertain ramifications ant's estimated valuation has dropped to as low as us 63 billion s 85 4 billion from more than us 300 billion at its peak in part because of the stricter regulations that come with being a financial holding company the mechanics of ring fencing tencent's financial business including interoperability between different platforms still need to be ironed out and arrangements could change the people said one certainty is that a financial holding company would mean additional capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny the wall street journal reported this week that tencent faces a record fine after the chinese authorities found that wechat pay had violated anti money laundering rules tencent is expected to maintain control of the new finance arm but one question is whether services accessed through wechat must in future offer equal ease of access to ant's rival alipay regulators considered tencent's current payments licence owned by its tenpay unit the back end provider of wallet services on wechat and qq as insufficient to cover wechat pay's services the people said the people's bank of china did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment tencent representatives declined to comment in april 2021 regulators summoned 13 firms including tencent meituan and bytedance to a meeting requiring them to restructure their financial wings into holding companies and sever improper links between their existing payments services and financial products the requests to tencent are similar to those imposed on ant which regulators said earlier this month has yet to complete its own overhaul executives have said that such a move should have minimal impact on operations tencent management including chief strategy officer james mitchell stressed during the company's may earnings call that its bread and butter in the finance business was payments which has lower risks but wechat pay is at the heart of the social media giant's businesses handling an estimated 40 per cent of china's mobile payments as at 2021 second only to alipay tencent's complex web of internal connections could complicate its separation from the rest of the company tencent's fintech and business division which includes cloud computing is its fastest growth engine contributing roughly 30 per cent of its total sales the biggest revenue source after gaming yet the services are supervised by different business groups unlike ant which consolidates all of its fintech operations into a single entity for instance the payments business straddles two units including wechat the instant messaging app and the fintech unit that provides the back end infrastructure under the leadership of the corporate development group more than a year after the chinese government snuffed out the biggest initial public offering in history by ant beijing's crackdown has snowballed into an assault on every corner of china's technosphere officials have handed out billions of dollars in antitrust fines to end the domination of a few heavyweights as president xi jinping pushes for more common prosperity yet on wednesday march 16 chinese officials led by vice premier liu he vowed to stabilise financial markets promising to ease a regulatory crackdown support property and technology companies and stimulate the economy mr liu stipulated that the rectification of major tech platforms should end as soon as possible the series of statements spurred a jaw dropping 32 per cent rebound in the hang seng tech index over two days with a gauge of china shares listed in hong kong soaring by the most since the financial crisis still it is unclear whether the regulatory tightening is peaking or ending as the government continues to implement a so called red light green light mechanism and tencent the world's biggest publisher of mobile games is dealing with other regulatory hurdles china's government has imposed strict curbs on gaming time for minors and has not approved a single new title for tencent or any other developer in months and last year the country's technology overseer warned internet firms to stop blocking rival services prompting wechat to start allowing external links to apps run by the likes of alibaba group and bytedance that

        "content": "san francisco bloomberg apple adjusted its app store review guidelines to loosen restrictions on iphone and ipad games that stream directly from the internet and in app purchase rules that have frustrated developers the changes are relatively small but they suggest apple is listening to app makers that have complained about the company's stringent guidelines apple is not changing its 15 per cent to 30 per cent fees taken from app downloads in app purchases and subscriptions but friday's update means that these fees will be applied in fewer cases the update doesn't affect the legal dispute between epic games and apple tim sweeney epic's chief executive officer criticised the announcement and said it won't change apple's grip on the mobile gaming business the biggest impact may come in the relatively new market for streaming video games for the first time apple will approve games that stream directly from the web versus from content installed on a device this reverses a rule that frustrated companies including microsoft nvidia and google all three rivals have streaming game services that are unavailable on apple's devices while apple's own arcade service is freely accessible the new rules will still require games to be submitted individually that means companies won't be able to launch all you can eat streaming game services on apple's platform but the change will still allow individual games to be played potentially giving apple users access to titles such as halo that are available online but not on iphones and ipads directly streaming games are permitted so long as they adhere to all guidelines for example each game update must be submitted for review developers must provide appropriate metadata for search games must use in app purchase to unlock features or functionality apple told developers in its updated review guidelines on friday sept 11 services such as microsoft's xcloud and google's stadia can now offer a catalog that directs apple users to other streaming games they offer but these catalogs must point players to the apple app store to download the other titles individually that will complicate a company's ability to launch a broad streaming games service but will at least make it possible with workarounds google declined to comment companies were previously able to offer individual streaming games as long as users streamed the game from a pc on the same wi fi connection as an apple device the rule changes mean that is no longer required this remains a bad experience for customers a microsoft spokesman said gamers want to jump directly into a game from their curated catalog within one app just like they do with movies or songs and not be forced to download over 100 apps to play individual games from the cloud apple is also no longer imposing its in app purchase requirements on online teaching apps such as tutoring or workout offerings this only applies to classes that are between two people some developers including facebook airbnb and classpass were frustrated that they had to give apple 30 per cent of class revenue given the pandemic has moved most learning online apple also tweaked its rules for in app purchases for some services such as email apps the guidelines now allow more apps to let users create free accounts apple also said that free apps acting as a stand alone companion to a paid web based tool do not need to use in app purchase provided there is no purchasing inside the app or calls to action for purchase outside of the app earlier this year the developer of an email app called hey complained after apple rejected one of its updates for trying to get around the in app purchase rules last week apple delayed changes to its upcoming ios 14 release that would have hurt facebook's advertising business the tweaks come ahead of apple launching new ipads and apple watches next week apple is in the middle of a lawsuit with epic games over epic's circumvention of the app store guidelines for in app purchases in its new guidelines the company says developers should not include any hidden dormant or undocumented features in your app this likely refers to epic hiding its own payment method during the app store review process then later enabling it over the internet join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "singapore hardwarezone more people are turning to notebooks as they seek a machine that offers them the flexibility to do work or to learn whenever and wherever in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic even though 75 per cent of workers have been able to return to their offices since april 5 flexible workplace hours are still encouraged analysts say notebook shipments have grown 20 per cent to 30 per cent in the past year advances in processor technologies and materials science mean ultra portable notebooks are more powerful more efficient and yet lighter than before we round up eight of the best ultra portable notebooks money can buy the acer swift 5 has been with us in some form for a couple of years now this year's model looks like it could be acer's best yet the swift 5 is a notebook that checks a lot of boxes it is light compact and has a nice bright display that is one of the better ones in this shootout it has great specifications with a good amount of memory and a generous amount of storage as well as a pleasant keyboard and trackpad one complaint is that it has only a single usb c port at 2 298 it is not cheap but at least it is reasonably priced this is the most complete zenbook yet asus really took a long hard look at its earlier notebooks and addressed almost all of their issues the zenbook 14 ultralight is compact and light performs well and has a long battery life and a good selection of ports the only knock against it is that it is pricier than its predecessors which is a shame because zenbooks used to be very affordable the new model's specifications are great too it is also the only notebook to have discrete graphics at 2 398 the zenbook 14 ultralight is one of the pricier models in this shootout but it has impressive features and performance the dell xps 13 has always been one of the most well rounded ultra portables the build is fantastic the display is gorgeous it has the best display in this shootout and the keyboard trackpad and speakers are all top notch too the downside is that it feels a little dense and heavy ports are a bit of an issue with only two usb c thunderbolt 4 ports for instance the xps 13 is available in a variety of configurations the version i reviewed costs 2 599 which makes it one of the pricier notebooks but the premium is somewhat justified by its exceptional build quality and mega display the matebook 14 amd runs a mid range ryzen 5 processor but its build quality is very good and feels much better than its 1 298 price tag would suggest on paper this notebook is irrefutably the one that is the most value for money option here its screen is easily one of the better displays in this shootout despite being prone to glare and reflections one shortcoming is its weight at 1 49kg it is easily the heaviest notebook here over 50 per cent heavier than some competitors another issue is ports it has no thunderbolt 3 or 4 ports the yoga slim 7i carbon is an appealing notebook based on its design features and respectable specifications for the 1 999 price tag its build quality is good the matte qhd display is sharp and the notebook is satisfying to use on all fronts using the keyboard and trackpad is pleasant for instance it is also the lightest notebook in this shootout at just 966g its top cover is made of carbon fibre which makes it 40 per cent lighter while raising structural rigidity by 25 per cent the notebook is dust and temperature resistant and can withstand drops from small heights the downside is that it has no usb a or hdmi ports lg's new gram 14 is its most refined ultra portable notebook yet its build quality has taken a positive step up the specifications are respectable and it has all if not most of the ports and features you would want from a portable everyday notebook it is also dust and temperature resistant and can withstand drops from small heights despite its 999g weight but the display left me with mixed feelings its colours are vivid and accurate looking but its unimpressive resolution of 1 920 x 1 200 pixels makes it less sharp than some of its rivals the version tested cost 2 199 but there is a cheaper version with a less powerful processor the 2 349 prestige 14 evo makes a very good first impression its specifications are good and it has a decent matte display a good selection of ports and a very large trackpad at 15 9mm thick and weighing 1 29kg the prestige 14 evo is not the slimmest or lightest the notebook can resist shocks vibrations humidity and dust but does not feel quite as well put together as its rivals its body has significant flex which may be disconcerting it is the only notebook in this selection to be powered by intel's top of the line tiger lake processor the core i7 1185g7 which has slightly higher base clock speeds than the core i7 1165g7 which most other notebooks use based on looks alone the razer book 13 would have been the winner it achieves the rare feat of being a genuinely good looking notebook this notebook's design and build quality are outstanding it is built like a rock and the specifications and feature set are good for instance the ports on this notebook are great while the glossy screen's sharpness is outstanding and the colours are vibrant but the top of the line model tested is pricey at 3 299 the notebook is also the heaviest here at 1 4kg over 400g heavier than some of its rivals with the exception of the huawei matebook 14 amd the rest of the notebooks in the shootout are powered by intel's new tiger lake processor and among them the msi prestige 14 evo is the only one that comes with the more powerful core i7 1185g7 variant the others have the standard core i7 1165g7 the notebooks were tested using the following benchmarks and applications pcmark 10 cinebench r23 geekbench 5 webxprt 3 3dmark and the tomb raider game despite most of these notebooks having very similar specifications their performance numbers can vary quite wildly this is because manufacturers have the freedom to set thermal thresholds for their products what this means is that even when two notebooks have the same processor one notebook might be quicker than the other if only because its maker decided to let it run hotter for longer this also explains why cooling solutions matter the standout performer was the acer swift 5 it came in first in most of the benchmarks and its all round performance was very good also commendable was the lenovo yoga slim 7i carbon which was not far off what was remarkable about these two notebooks was how they were able to maintain consistent numbers even when taxed such as in the tomb raider test also impressive was the huawei matebook 14 amd it may have only a ryzen 5 processor but its overall performance was mostly competitive especially when you recall that it is the most affordable notebook here by a considerable margin its graphics performance was lacking however if any notebook's performance could be described as disappointing then it would be the msi prestige 14 evo maybe msi was being conservative but the notebook's performance was not commensurate with the fact that it is equipped with what is on paper the most powerful processor raw performance alone does not make a good ultra portable notebook battery life is important too battery tests on the eight notebooks were conducted using pcmark 10's battery benchmark with displays set to 100 per cent brightness the battery lives of the notebooks were generally quite good even with their displays at maximum brightness and the notebooks themselves running a multitude of tasks most of them managed to last well over six hours the standout performers were the acer swift 5 and lg gram 14 the swift 5's long battery life is even more impressive when you consider the fact that it does not have the largest battery it sips power at a remarkable rate the only other notebook that came close enough to matching this efficiency was the lenovo yoga slim 7i carbon the lenovo would have lasted longer if it had a larger battery its 50wh battery is the smallest of the bunch another takeaway from the tests is how the display affects power efficiency in the modern office battery tests the most power hungry notebooks were often those with high resolution displays the razer book 13 which has a bright 4k display consumed battery at a rate that was easily double those of other notebooks with full hd displays meanwhile credit must be given to the dell xps 13 for keeping power consumption reasonable even though it also has a 4k display the lenovo yoga slim 7i carbon also deserves a mention it has a qhd resolution display but it was still one of the most power efficient notebooks the ultra portable notebooks in this shootout are very competent machines performance and battery life were generally quite good across the board although there were some standouts it is also nice to see that nearly all of them support the new and faster thunderbolt 4 standard this is significant as it opens up a wide range of peripherals that you can enhance your machines with most crucially it means you can dock these notebooks to an external graphics processing unit and have a truly competent gaming machine the lenovo yoga slim 7i carbon is our winner because it checks the most boxes at just 966g it is the lightest of the bunch coupled with its svelte body it easily slips into bags and notebook sleeves and despite being so thin and light it sacrifices little in the way of performance in performance tests it ranked consistently among the top and even though this model had the smallest battery it lasted well over nine hours and was one of the more power efficient notebooks this is even more remarkable when you consider that it has a higher resolution qhd display and not a full hd display like some of its rivals to round it up it has no fewer than three usb c ports support for wi fi 6 a very pleasant keyboard and a large touchpad and there is the price the yoga slim 7i carbon is the second most affordable notebook in this shootout it offers just about everything you would want from an ultra portable notebook it is hard to argue against the huawei matebook 14 amd when you look at the price tags of these machines at 1 298 it is 701 less than the next most affordable notebook sure we can nitpick its performance and feature set but it counters with class leading build quality and that gorgeous high resolution display with a 3 2 aspect ratio if you are looking to get the most out of your hard earned dollars the matebook 14 amd is the undisputed winner it offers unrivalled performance and battery life and is also impressively light and compact however its full hd display is looking dated and it has only a single usb c port overall it is an excellent notebook but not quite as refined and modern as our winner it has impressive specifications it is very thin and light has discrete graphics and is one of only two notebooks to come with a 1tb solid state drive sadly its performance was not quite as good as we hoped throttling was quite severe during heavy workload tests the full hd display also looks quite dated and the notebook is quite pricey it looks and feels expensive the display is fantastic with super thin bezels razor sharp visuals and vibrant colours the only knocks against it are its so so performance and high price tag but if you have a fat wallet and you value visual quality over outright performance this is still a good choice this is the company's most polished ultra portable notebook yet the gram 14 has always distinguished itself for its light weight and long battery life and this new model continues the tradition performance used to be a weak point but that is no longer the case this model performs quite admirably although throttling is a bit of an issue it also has the best selection of ports its standing would have been elevated if only it had a better display and a more attractive price nevertheless this is a very solid option especially if you are looking for a notebook that has every port you will ever need is super light and has great endurance it was disappointing mainly because of its performance despite having the most powerful processor it was unable to put the power down and distinguish itself in our benchmark tests it goes to show that specifications on paper are not everything and when you consider its price and everything else it offers it is clear that there are better options out there if these notebooks were judged on looks alone this model would have probably won its design is as attractive as it is distinctive and it feels well put together the 4k touchscreen display is also stunning sadly its performance was not very strong and neither was its battery life furthermore it is the most expensive notebook by a huge margin when you put it all together regardless of how good it looks it just does not represent good

        "content": "singapore the battle of the next generation video game consoles has finally reached the shores of singapore microsoft launched its latest xbox series x xsx here on nov 10 while sony released its playstation 5 ps5 on thursday nov 19 they have been a long time coming about seven years to be precise the xsx and ps5 available on amazon replace the ageing xbox one and ps4 respectively launched in early 2014 and late 2013 their faster variants aside the new consoles boast improvements over their predecessors such as supporting games with better graphics and loading games more quickly but how are they different and which one should you get for a start the xsx costs 699 while the ps5 is slightly pricier at 729 their disc less variants are cheaper and have different issues to contend with the bad news is the first batch of xsx and ps5 consoles is already sold out here likely due to supply falling short of keen demand that was further boosted by the covid 19 pandemic while the wait is on for new stocks to arrive in december or january the straits times compares the xsx and the ps5 to help you decide which gaming machine to go for the two consoles look substantially different the xsx is shorter and wider while the ps5 is taller and thinner personal taste about design should help you decide jibes at how the xsx looks like a fridge and the ps5 like a router aside as far as this writer is concerned the ps5 wins easily with its curvy white side panels and futuristic looks furthermore it comes with an equally futuristic looking dualsense wireless controller the xsx's boxy black exterior looks boring by comparison its wireless game controller looks no different from the previous generation the ps5's dualsense controller has another ace up its sleeve that the xsx one lacks it features improved vibrations that heighten interactions with the game world this sounds like a gimmick but i was blown over after i started using the controller when playing the ps5's bundled astro's playroom game the controller's built in speaker gives off a ping sound when a coin is collected and with its new haptic feedback feature the controller rumbles and vibrates differently when moving across different surfaces for example when walking through sand the controller vibrates more slowly and with less intensity but across a hard surface vibrations come in short spurts but are more intense these differing vibrations sort of mirror real world contact with these surfaces in a way last gen controllers could not in the playstation exclusive action game spider man miles morales the controller rumbles subtly first then with growing intensity over time when powering up an attack in previous generation controllers the vibrations would have been less nuanced and felt less natural the ps5 controller's dynamic adaptive triggers also mean that as the player swings across new york city as the titular game character in spider man miles morales resistance is felt when the trigger buttons are pressed the tightening of the triggers varies depending on how far into the swinging animation the game character is in this feature was completely absent in last gen controllers in contrast the xsx controller behaves similar to the xbox one controller vibration wise there is a downer for the ps5 though it supports ps4 controllers when playing ps4 games on the ps5 but does not support the same controllers when playing ps5 games on the other hand the xsx supports last gen xbox one controllers winner ps5 under the hood the ps5 and xsx are more similar than some might realise both feature amd's zen 2 central processing unit cpu and amd's rdna 2 graphics processing unit gpu on paper the xsx has a slightly faster cpu and gpu but in practical terms the xsx's performance may not be too different from the ps5's for many games it comes down to the game being able to harness the new processing power of the consoles playing the nba 2k21 basketball simulation game on both consoles gameplay was smooth for either and there was no noticeable difference in performance between the two machines the xsx and ps5 both have hard drives that allow games to load much more quickly so that players can dive into the action faster this writer found out that a basketball match in nba 2k21 takes under 5 seconds to load on both the xsx and ps5 with hardly any difference in loading times between the consoles in contrast the game can take 30 seconds or more on last gen consoles that is a significantly longer waiting time that might be enough for one to read a news report the xsx and ps5 support ray tracing technology that improves lighting effects dramatically both machines can also run games at a naturally higher 4k resolution which is four times sharper than that for the xbox one and ps4 rendering visual details with more clarity together these two features make games for next gen consoles look more realistic than before in nba 2k21 players' skin textures as well as basketball courts look fantastic on bothxsx and ps5 with nary a difference the eye can see but compared with last gen consoles the game on next gen definitely looks more crisp light bounces off things and basketball players in a more realistic and natural way the caveat with gaming in 4k is that you also need a television screen or monitor that can support this the xsx and ps5 also support higher game frame rates of up to 120 frames per second fps compared with up to 60fps on last gen consoles this means movement in games can appear a lot smoother and more responsive especially during fast moving sequences this is partly due to less lag between pushing a button and seeing an action performed on screen but for now many games do not support such high frame rates and so more testing is needed winner tie jumping straight into the game is important for many gamers but to do so they have to navigate a game console's user interface ui first sony claims its ps5 ui has been streamlined however this writer was unable to access games and other features as quickly as he would have liked for example in the playstation store you cannot use the bumpers of the controller to reach the store's shopping cart like with the ps4 instead you have to use the mini joystick on the controller these minor quirks can be frustrating but this could be a matter of getting used to the new interface on the other hand the xsx retains the ui of its predecessor so for xbox one gamers the xsx's menu system is comfortable and familiar territory some might love this familiarity while others might want something fresh this writer prefers what he is used to especially since he wants the quickest way to start a game switching between games is possible with the new consoles for the xsx this is its quick resume feature which allows you to pause a game you are playing start a different game pause that one and switch back to your first game to resume where you left off this is almost instantaneous and there is no need to reload from scratch reload a save game or navigate too many menus however not all games that are supposed to support quick resume are working right now for example toggling between nba 2k21 and assassin's creed valhalla instantly is not possible as of press time some fixes are on the way the ps5 has a similar function called switcher but it is not as fast as quick resume when you toggle between games you will need to wait for the game to reload and load a saved game winner xsx all comparisons between consoles are for nought if they do not have the games you want to play at launch the ps5 is clearly winning in terms of its exclusive games with the superb spider man miles morales and the utterly difficult but incredible remastered demon's souls even its free astro's playroom platformer is an exhilarating experience for the family and if you subscribe to the playstation plus service 8 90 per month or 53 90 per year you can access a slew of ps4 games on the ps5 many of which are exclusives and arguably genre defining the service is unfortunately needed to play some multi player games online but there are other perks like game discounts and a free ps5 game a month this month it is bugsnax a cute first person adventure game for xsx there are no real blockbuster exclusive games to speak of because its halo infinite and new fable games are not likely to be released until next year that said microsoft has bought many game companies over the years with the latest and most high profile addition to date being bethesda the maker of the hit fallout and elder scrolls games so the xsx's library of exclusives could grow substantially in the future however the xsx's biggest draw is xbox game pass ultimate 19 99 per month it offers over 100 high quality games for xbox consoles pc and even android including all microsoft first party games like the classic halo games and new exclusives added when they are released furthermore since nov 10 ea play has joined the service expanding its game library with the likes of star wars jedi fallen order like playstation plus xbox game pass ultimate is needed to play some online multi player games and it also gives subscribers store discounts the xsx also trumps the ps5 in another area better backwards compatibility microsoft claims the xsx supports all last gen xbox one games it even supports selected games from xbox 360 and first generation xbox consoles while the ps5 is said to support most ps4 games it does not support ps3 or older games winner tie ultimately pitting the playstation against the xbox is akin to the seemingly neverending war between android and ios mobile operating systems there will always be hardcore supporters on both sides the xsx has its value for money xbox game pass ultimate subscription service with a big game library at your fingertips while the ps5 has a bevy of exclusives including sackboy a big adventure platform game which is available now and the gran turismo 7 racing simulator on the horizon but should you wait to get either console or even both if you do not worry about missing out then probably yes since you cannot get hold of one now anyway and prices on the secondary market can be astronomical many next gen console exclusive games are also still not available so there is no harm waiting as with any new tech product launch there could also be issues with the first batch of goods so sometimes waiting a bit may not be a bad thing hopefully these problems could be ironed out later there are reports of the new consoles crashing on gamers but it is unclear for now what the reasons are make of it what you will should you upgrade from your existing xbox one or ps4 definitely but with caveats compared with their predecessors seven years ago the xsx is 60 more expensive and the ps5 is 90 more costly the graphical improvements for next gen consoles can be big with better lighting effects and support for higher resolutions they also have much faster game loading times than last gen machines ultimately whether you should buy an xsx or ps5 or both depends on a number of things your budget whether you can wait the selection of games you are hankering for the crop of titles expected in the future and maybe even how the console looks in your room this

19 following russia's invasion of ukraine mahuchikh was forced to flee her home hide out in a cellar and eventually make the 2 000km trip over three days to belgrade to face what she dubbed her own front line the reigning european indoor high jump champion who won olympic bronze in tokyo last summer and world outdoor silver in doha in 2019 left her home in dnipro just three weeks ago as the conflict escalated training needless to say was low on her list of priorities but she did succeed in finding her way to serbia after hundreds of phone calls many changes of direction explosions fires and air raid sirens this medal is for ukraine all my country all my people all the military said mahuchikh i must protect my country on the track in an international arena before we went to the field the only thought in my mind was about ukraine because too many terrible things have happened there they killed our people and they killed our nation and they killed our children the future of ukraine she said of russian military actions i don't know what they want because we enjoy our life in ukraine i think a lot of people in russia must understand that this war in ukraine is true i know that a lot of russian people said that it's all fake the videos are all fake but a lot of our cities have been destroyed how was that fake arriving in serbia mahuchikh said she even doubted that she could jump at all but my coach said i must go out and perform with the shape and fitness i had before the start of the russian invasion coming into the competition at 1 88m mahuchikh had a failure at 1 92 and two at 2 00 before making the latter height she sailed over 2 02 to ramp up the pressure on eleanor patterson the australian responded by passing so the bar was raised to 2 04m but when patterson failed at the new height mahuchikh was left celebrating in the stark arena the crowd rising for a standing ovation with a handful of ukrainian flags fluttering world athletics president sebastian coe handed mahuchikh a hand written letter signed off with thanks and admiration when presenting her with the gold medal your performance this morning is testimony to your passion for our sport and your resolve at such an awful time for your country coe said in the letter seen by afp i know i speak on behalf of all the world athletics family when i convey mighty thanks for the supreme effort you and your ukrainian team have made to be with us in belgrade world athletics will do all it can to support the needs of the athletes of ukraine we have already created a fund to that end patterson claimed silver with 2 00m with kazakhstan's nadezhda dubovitskaya taking bronze 1 98 to win a silver behind yaroslava makes it even more special said patterson who had painted her nails with a blue and yellow love heart in support of ukraine she's had to deal with such hardships that no one deserves to so i'm incredibly proud of her too i'm in the same hotel as the ukrainian team and i was able to see them beforehand and exchange small smiles and little gestures of support mahuchikh said she had been grateful for the support shown to her and the five other members of the all female ukraine team in belgrade i saw that eleanor had manicured her nails with ukrainian colours and a big yellow heart she said my heart right now is with all people who support us and defend ukraine mahuchikh's teammate iryna gerashchenko who fled her kyiv home with her husband and dog amid everything at once bombs and rockets but no kit finished fifth in the high jump with a best of 1 92m i have such respect for both girls and all the ukrainians who have made it here added patterson it's incredible to see them and phenomenal for yaroslava to come away with the gold mahuchikh's victory came in the absence of russia's mariya lasitskene who won gold in tokyo competing as an accredited neutral athlete but lasitskene was ruled out of the world indoors following world athletics' ban on russian and belarusian athletes in light of what coe dubbed the barbaric invasion of ukraine looking ahead mahuchikh said she had no idea how she would prepare for a busy season that includes the world outdoor championships in eugene oregon and the european championships in munich germany i am so sorry that i cannot go back to ukraine i want to go back as soon as possible maybe from april she said adding that she would

19 following russia's invasion of ukraine mahuchikh was forced to flee her home hide out in a cellar and eventually make the 2 000km trip over three days to belgrade to face what she dubbed her own front line the reigning european indoor high jump champion who won olympic bronze in tokyo last summer and world outdoor silver in doha in 2019 left her home in dnipro just three weeks ago as the conflict escalated training needless to say was low on her list of priorities but she did succeed in finding her way to serbia after hundreds of phone calls many changes of direction explosions fires and air raid sirens this medal is for ukraine all my country all my people all the military said mahuchikh i must protect my country on the track in an international arena before we went to the field the only thought in my mind was about ukraine because too many terrible things have happened there they killed our people and they killed our nation and they killed our children the future of ukraine she said of russian military actions i don't know what they want because we enjoy our life in ukraine i think a lot of people in russia must understand that this war in ukraine is true i know that a lot of russian people said that it's all fake the videos are all fake but a lot of our cities have been destroyed how was that fake arriving in serbia mahuchikh said she even doubted that she could jump at all but my coach said i must go out and perform with the shape and fitness i had before the start of the russian invasion coming into the competition at 1 88m mahuchikh had a failure at 1 92 and two at 2 00 before making the latter height she sailed over 2 02 to ramp up the pressure on eleanor patterson the australian responded by passing so the bar was raised to 2 04m but when patterson failed at the new height mahuchikh was left celebrating in the stark arena the crowd rising for a standing ovation with a handful of ukrainian flags fluttering world athletics president sebastian coe handed mahuchikh a hand written letter signed off with thanks and admiration when presenting her with the gold medal your performance this morning is testimony to your passion for our sport and your resolve at such an awful time for your country coe said in the letter seen by afp i know i speak on behalf of all the world athletics family when i convey mighty thanks for the supreme effort you and your ukrainian team have made to be with us in belgrade world athletics will do all it can to support the needs of the athletes of ukraine we have already created a fund to that end patterson claimed silver with 2 00m with kazakhstan's nadezhda dubovitskaya taking bronze 1 98 to win a silver behind yaroslava makes it even more special said patterson who had painted her nails with a blue and yellow love heart in support of ukraine she's had to deal with such hardships that no one deserves to so i'm incredibly proud of her too i'm in the same hotel as the ukrainian team and i was able to see them beforehand and exchange small smiles and little gestures of support mahuchikh said she had been grateful for the support shown to her and the five other members of the all female ukraine team in belgrade i saw that eleanor had manicured her nails with ukrainian colours and a big yellow heart she said my heart right now is with all people who support us and defend ukraine mahuchikh's teammate iryna gerashchenko who fled her kyiv home with her husband and dog amid everything at once bombs and rockets but no kit finished fifth in the high jump with a best of 1 92m i have such respect for both girls and all the ukrainians who have made it here added patterson it's incredible to see them and phenomenal for yaroslava to come away with the gold mahuchikh's victory came in the absence of russia's mariya lasitskene who won gold in tokyo competing as an accredited neutral athlete but lasitskene was ruled out of the world indoors following world athletics' ban on russian and belarusian athletes in light of what coe dubbed the barbaric invasion of ukraine looking ahead mahuchikh said she had no idea how she would prepare for a busy season that includes the world outdoor championships in eugene oregon and the european championships in munich germany i am so sorry that i cannot go back to ukraine i want to go back as soon as possible maybe from april she said adding that she would

injury the 34 year old got hurt in the second quarter of golden state's eventual 110 88 defeat in san francisco and he was ruled out for the second half of the contest after a half time examination the injury occurred with just over four minutes remaining in the second quarter when curry struggling to keep possession of the ball near mid court had boston's marcus smart land on the back of his left leg while diving for possession curry had his foot twist awkwardly in the incident and shortly thereafter had to be removed from the game he headed straight to the locker room walking unassisted warriors coach steve kerr said post game i thought it was a dangerous play i thought marcus dove into steph and that's what i was upset about a lot of respect for marcus he's a hell of a player a gamer a competitor i coached him in the world cup a few summers ago we talked after the game and we're good but i thought it was a dangerous play as for curry's status moving forward kerr said we'll know after the mri the warriors were losing 33 25 at the time of the incident curry was limited to three points a three pointer in 14 minutes golden state trailed 48 32 at half time its lowest scoring output in any half this national basketball association season in successfully bouncing back from a home loss to the dallas mavericks on sunday the celtics were up by as many as 24 in the third quarter before the warriors rallied jayson tatum and jaylen brown scored 26 points apiece for boston and robert williams iii contributed to the cause with eight points nine rebounds and four blocks payton pritchard finished with 10 points while smart with a game high eight assists chipped in with 20 points he said he understood kerr's criticism but insisted he would never intentionally hurt a fellow professional kerr is doing what any coach or person would do and that's backing up his guys smart said me and steve have a relationship from usa basketball so he knows i'm never trying to hurt anybody i hate to see any injury i hope steph's all right i didn't even see him just dove on the ball and tried to make a play i'm really down right now about it smart added i know who i am my teammates and my colleagues know i'm not a dirty player unfortunately sometimes injuries happen i'm sure i'm going to get called dirty that's their opinion making six of his 13 three point attempts jordan poole led all scorers with 29 points for the warriors who shot 37 2 per cent from the floor klay thompson added 18 on an 8 for 24 shooting night while kevon looney had nine points and a team high tying eight rebounds meanwhile spencer dinwiddie scored a buzzer beating three pointer as the dallas mavericks staged a dramatic comeback to end the brooklyn nets' four game winning streak dinwiddie's 25 foot winner sealed a pulsating tussle in brooklyn which had been dominated by a thrilling duel between nets star kevin durant and the mavericks' luka doncic durant looked to have edged the nets into a game winning position with 10 seconds remaining after sinking a three pointer from 27 feet to put brooklyn 111 110 ahead just after doncic's fadeaway jumper gave dallas a slender 110 108 lead but with the last play of the game doncic worked the ball to dinwiddie on the edge of the arc and the shooting guard made no mistake with the three for a 113 111 victory it capped a superb fourth quarter performance from dinwiddie who scored 15 of his 22 points in the final period but dinwiddie who joined dallas in a trade from the washington wizards last month insisted that doncic who finished with 37 points with nine rebounds and nine assists should take the credit that was luka making a play rather than me doing anything special he said elsewhere joel embiid celebrated his 28th birthday with a 35 point display as the philadelphia 76ers held on for a 118 114 win over the cleveland cavaliers the sixers looked to be cruising after a dominant first half which included a 42 point second quarter to put them 72 59 ahead at the break but an improved cavaliers defensive display stifled the sixers' scoring in the third period as the home side outscored the visitors 31 13 to lead by five heading into the final quarter philadelphia took control in the fourth quarter however with embiid james harden and tyrese maxey combining for 25 points to shepherd the sixers over the line embiid finished with 35 points 17 rebounds and five assists with support from maxey 25 points harden 21 and tobias harris 19 embiid was in anything but a celebratory mood however after a game which saw the sixers almost squander a 17 point lead obviously we made the right plays at the end but we can't keep blowing these leads he said we've got to do a better job especially when we get these

        "content": "this is part of a weekly series of feature stories videos and podcasts in which the straits times correspondents cast the spotlight on people and communities around the region who are living in the shadows of their societies where they exist largely unseen unheard and little talked about tokyo nikko tochigi growing up i was embarrassed by myself by my family and by my living conditions i was embarrassed by my grandmother who could not read and write because she did not go to school i was embarrassed by the jobs held by my neighbours i was embarrassed by how my house was very small rundown and shabby i kept wanting to escape this life professor risa kumamoto 48 has indeed come a long way from her childhood home a hamlet of shunned untouchables and escaped the grips of oppressive poverty and outright discrimination my mother was from a burakumin family there was huge opposition from my father s family many things added up over time leading up to divorce now lecturing at kindai university in osaka she is a respected academic in the fields of human rights research and sociology but as a descendant of burakumin literally hamlet people getting to where she is entailed overcoming a mountain of odds burakumin are the underclass in a centuries old social hierarchy that is a relic of the feudal shogunate era the caste system was outlawed in 1871 and the burakumin emancipated but the yoke of oppression remains the burakumin were considered unclean for holding jobs shunned by the wider shinto and buddhist society often ones involving animals blood or death they include butchers leather tanners animal trainers as well as executioners funeral undertakers and garbage collectors they lived in ghettos buraku outside the gated communities of the higher caste samurai warriors farmers artisans and merchants they were oppressed by laws that mandated even their hairstyles the colour of their clothes and the types of shoes they wore while no longer shackled by these visible identifiers the burakumin were for generations stuck in lowly paid jobs with poor educational opportunities and living in rundown housing prof kumamoto recalled never inviting friends home on the way home together with her schoolmates she would alight several bus stops away from her hamlet and walk the rest of the way home i just didn t want them to know that i am burakumin the pain of being burakumin hit home early in life for her she was six when her parents marriage crumbled under social pressure my mother was from a burakumin family in fukuoka my father wasn t there was huge opposition from my father s family when they got married after that as husband and wife they were looked down upon many things added up over time leading up to divorce the split made her acutely conscious of being burakumin even as she and her mother continued living in the hamlet in fukuoka thanks to government policies to help burakumin she was able to get an education but her ancestry continued to dog her prof kumamoto vividly remembers how in university her then boyfriend told her to hide her identity he told me you are a good person but it is better not to mention your burakumin background to my family for your own good this isn t discrimination but mentioning it draws unnecessary attention to it so it is just better not to talk about it at all while buraku hamlets have been torn down in areas around and north of tokyo they still exist albeit with facilities modernised and gates torn down in western japan areas such as osaka and kyoto available official figures from 1993 indicate that 4 442 such communities existed nationwide today the japanese government recognises only those who still live in those hamlets as burakumin about 900 000 by official estimates the buraku liberation league bll however said the actual number is closer to three million many have long moved out of those hamlets and sought jobs without the stigma of what their forefathers had to do while most burakumin are no longer recognisable by their jobs or their addresses prejudice against them manifests in both overt and covert forms they have been sent death threats had their homes vandalised with obscene graffiti or been called names like scum and maggots on social media there have also been cases where burakumin were purportedly targeted as convenient scapegoats for crimes without any evidence mr taro murasaki 59 who runs the osaru land theme park in nikko north of tokyo followed in his father s footsteps as a monkey trainer one of the so called unclean trades associated with burakumin he said people sometimes still refer to him derogatorily as aiitsu or that person presumably because of his caste and profession in less overt cases burakumin can be bypassed for promotions at work shunned by their associates or excluded from gatherings with friends they may also be subject to background checks in employment or marriage family registers kept at town halls could be accessed freely until just decades ago while old documents with names and addresses of burakumin continue to be circulated on the black market many burakumin will remember how the late former chief cabinet secretary hiromu nonaka was blocked from becoming prime minister when political elite taro aso who is now finance minister said in 2001 are we really going to let those people become the leader of japan bll vice chairman akiyuki kataoka 72 told st that many burakumin conceal their lineage to avoid societal discrimination it is also common he added for many to have chosen not to tell their children of their ancestry in order to protect them a special law was passed in 1969 to provide public housing public health and education facilities and scholarships for the burakumin who had been routinely neglected for education jobs and welfare benefits some 15 trillion yen s 184 billion was spent over 33 years until the law lapsed in 2002 preferential placement programmes also helped burakumin secure places in school and municipal jobs helping their social mobility but sociologist ryushi uchida of kansai university told the straits times that the law has been perceived as affirmative action by some and fuelled discrimination while it has also been exploited by some burakumin with links to the yakuza mob there have been questions like why do those people deserve special treatment for prof kumamoto her decision to come out as burakumin came about after she went to canada to further her studies in the 1990s meeting indigenous peoples immigrants and sexual minorities she saw how they had a history of fighting against discrimination discrimination must be confronted head on in the past i ran away i hid i was disgusted by my lineage but now i see that my friends can look at society through me it was a huge turning point for her instead of running away discrimination must be confronted head on she said in the past i ran away i hid i was disgusted by my lineage but now i see that my friends can look at society through me and they can learn about history from my experiences still there is a difference between choosing to come out and being outed she said using terms regularly used by the lgbtq lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer community terms also often used by the burakumin in japan the fact is efforts to ferret out the burakumin still persist often in the name of academic research and freedom of speech some 248 persons of burakumin lineage some of them professors and some others businessmen have brought a class action lawsuit against publisher tatsuhiko miyabe 42 for disseminating their names and addresses online a verdict is due in september one of the plaintiffs is mrs tami kamikawa 41 her parents were born in buraku communities in mie and osaka prefecture and had met after moving to tokyo as young adults in the hope of more favourable prospects they would have hoped for their daughter to not live through discrimination for being burakumin but mrs kamikawa who founded non profit group buraku heritage in 2011 to counter the spread of hatred said hate speech is still disseminated online she too has struggled with micro aggression in the form of people who deny the struggles of her lineage she recalled being upfront about her identity and the struggles her family had faced to her friends and teachers in school she only learnt about the existence of her aunt in secondary school after her father told her that she had severed all ties with the family as a condition for marriage to prepare her for the types of discrimination she may face she raised this with her teacher in school but was plainly accused of exaggerating her concerns she recalled being told such buraku prejudice is a historical issue you must be lying if you say this still exists mrs kamikawa told st there are a lot of pent up feelings from when i have been told to stop imagining things she has not however been imagining things a government survey in 2017 found that just 11 8 per cent of japanese believe burakumin discrimination no longer exists with 40 1 per cent seeing such prejudice in marriage and 23 5 per cent in jobs another by the tokyo metropolitan government in 2014 found that 26 6 per cent would oppose their children marrying someone of burakumin lineage led by the ruling liberal democratic party ldp the diet passed an act in 2016 to promote the elimination of buraku discrimination the law recognises the fact that buraku discrimination still exists even today and that the situation has evolved with the increasing use of the internet and seeks to improve the understanding of each and every citizen on the need to eliminate buraku discrimination it does not however impose any punitive measures and lawmaker tsuyoshi yamaguchi 66 who heads the ldp s sub committee on buraku issues acknowledged that the law is not forceful enough there is still discrimination when burakumin are getting married or finding jobs we need to hasten our efforts for more effective laws the six term lawmaker whose ward in hyogo prefecture is home to many buraku industries like leather production told st mr yamaguchi who is not of buraku lineage added that even the passage of the watered down law was problematic the idea of including prohibitive clauses was contentious in the ldp especially among the more conservative and in the face of the freedom of speech counter argument he said the law only came into being because secretary general toshihiro nikai was driving it even then prime minister shinzo abe used to oppose it some people defend discrimination as their right of free speech but how can one person s rights come at the expense of another s asked if japan was ready for a prime minister of buraku heritage mr yamaguchi told st if one s great great great grandparent lived in a buraku community who cares some municipalities have been more progressive in terms of anti prejudice ordinances kawasaki to the south of tokyo which is home to a large zainichi ethnic korean population became the first municipality to ban hate speech last year last month mie prefecture became the first municipality in japan to ban the outing of lgbtq individuals for abattoir worker yuki miyazaki this offers a ray of hope for eradicating discrimination against burakumin this momentum must spread nationwide he told st some people defend discrimination as their right of free speech but how can one person s rights come at the expense of another s mr miyazaki 38 who has been working at the shibaura meat market in tokyo for 20 years wields a deft hand at preparing cuts of pricey wagyu beef he has had slurs thrown his way because of his profession even before he came out as burakumin people can do anything they want to me but if they attack my two children i can t always be there to protect them i am cautious about revealing my identity because i need to keep them safe this is a shame as i am proud of my roots and my work calling for more education at all levels of society he said there is a school of thought that the problem will eventually wither up and disappear if people keep silent with the idea of not waking up a sleeping child i don t think so it is important to tell people accurately about history and reality and have them face up to their own prejudices mr murasaki the monkey theme park owner recalled when i was young i always had trouble meeting or dating girls once their families knew of my background they always stopped their daughters from going out with me he took on the job knowing full well that it would be a clear marker of his status as an untouchable i want to be true to myself rather than hiding in the shadows it is important to push society to realise there is no reason behind its prejudices in time mr murasaki found fame appearing on television in his 20s showing off his monkeys performing skits and playing football and table hockey besides operating his theme park in the city of nikko north of tokyo since 2015 he and his simian troupe have also been invited to perform abroad despite the insults that he sometimes encounters he will not hide his lineage with a rise in awareness in human rights and anti discrimination movements i want to be true to myself rather than hiding in the shadows it is important to push society to realise there is no reason behind its prejudices he said isn t it unbelievable that a democratic country like japan is so stuck mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media

are living in the shadows of their societies where they exist largely unseen unheard and little talked about bangalore mr pedanna g had just put his feet up on the bed in his two room house in bangalore when his phone rang for the fourth time that sunday another person with a blocked toilet he said hopping off the bed and slipping on his khaki work shirt and mask even before he had reached the end of the street his phone rang again it was the same person confirming if mr pedanna was on his way could he hurry please could he take an autorickshaw instead of the bus rich people panic when their loo is overflowing that is when they need me the most said mr pedanna 55 the man on the phone called mr pedanna anna older brother but after 20 years of cleaning toilets drains and manholes he knew that it was lip service as soon as clean water began to gush through the pipes and the customer was flooded with relief their hierarchies would snap back in place i just hope he gives me fair wages mr pedanna said hailing a tuk tuk whose fare he hoped the customer would pay he usually charges 1 000 rupees s 18 30 per cleaning job but without fixed wages payments are always uncertain for freelance workers like him mr pedanna is what india calls a manual scavenger in cities and villages it is common to see men and women cleaning latrines and sewers using brooms sticks and often bare hands these workers manually carry and dispose of human excreta from streets gutters and septic tanks in homes offices and hospitals some enter manholes with sewage water up to their necks to unclog pipes the work remains essential due to the country s inadequate sewerage system and lack of home toilets which leads to open defecation in rural india and slums a third of the people relieve themselves in the streets and open fields even in urban areas only 30 per cent of households have toilets connected to waterborne sewer systems common latrines are often little more than holes in the ground and when they get full someone is needed to clear them out where it exists the sewerage system is often old and easily clogged some cities such as bangalore have mechanised systems to fix major blockages and corporations are banned from using manual cleaners but in old or rapidly growing neighbourhoods without proper drainage systems people still call for someone to put their hand into faecal sludge or jump into a sewer to manually unclog it people hurl insults at my caste when i take the bus some don t let me sit maybe i stink some won t give me water to drink or wash my hands unless poor most indians tend to employ someone else to clean their toilets and by extension their sewers in a caste ridden society this work was often forced upon a sub group of dalits a marginalised community of former untouchables to repair centuries of oppression india today penalises such caste discrimination and has a system of affirmative action the present indian president is a dalit man but to this day dalits in the country remain poor and shunned by society the most oppressed groups among them are forced to clean sewers the work is disgusting and dangerous in the past five years to december last year 340 people have died from inhaling noxious fumes or slipping in manholes thousands of others such as mr pedanna have had wounds and cuts all over their hands and legs chronic aches and breathing difficulties unlike sanitation workers they get no equipment or protective gear but what hurts most of all is the humiliation we are subjected to said mr pedanna it is not uncommon for people to abuse or beat him up as he waited for a cup of tea at a small shop the store owner kept a wide distance and put the water jug away to prevent him from drinking from it people hurl insults at my caste when i take the bus some don t let me sit maybe i stink some won t give me water to drink or wash my hands frankly it is very painful i keep a smiling face but at the end of the day i feel depressed mr pedanna said why am i stuck doing this job manual scavenging is perhaps modern india s greatest shame recognised as a form of slavery it was outlawed in 1993 since then it has been illegal for anyone to employ manual scavengers still thousands continue to manually clear sewers and toilets due to their poverty and place in the caste hierarchy officially their numbers have dropped from 770 338 in 2008 to about 48 000 in january last year but activists say this is a gross under assessment and put the number closer to around 1 2 million the socio economic caste census of 2011 has also identified 182 505 indian households with the primary occupation of manual scavenging incomplete and half hearted surveys seek to make an already invisible community disappear from the records said mr bezwada wilson one of the founders of the safai karmachari andolan a nationwide movement to eradicate manual scavenging a november 2019 report by the world health organisation found that the indian government s attempts to show fewer indians engaged in this dehumanising work had only driven manual scavenging underground ms vani nagendrappa managing director of a company the karnataka state government formed in 2016 to offer loans and support to sanitation workers to shift to other jobs said we do public awareness campaigns to inform citizens that if they employ manual cleaners for their homes they will be jailed but they continue to call them out of ignorance and habit and the workers continue to go we need citizens to report where it is happening for us to be able to stop it she said the workers lack of bargaining power illiteracy social vulnerability and poverty combined with weak legal oversight have led to the worst riskiest sanitation jobs such as sewer cleaning being subcontracted to temporary informal workers the municipality contractor had forced my son to enter a manhole he felt faint due to the gases and fell he drowned in the sewage manual scavengers working independently under the radar have no protections or safety nets mr narayanswamy muniappa a 66 year old sewer cleaner lost his 25 year old son to the same job two decades ago the municipality contractor had forced my son to enter a manhole he felt faint due to the gases and fell he drowned in the sewage before his partner pulled him out said mr narayanswamy who cannot forget the black sludge oozing from his son s nostrils throughout the funeral accidents from losing consciousness and death by asphyxiation in septic tanks and sewers pit collapse or falling masonry and wounds from sharp debris are shockingly frequent if a worker dies while performing such work even with safety gear and other precautions the police are required to investigate the case and get the employer to pay a million rupees to the family mr narayanswamy tried to collect the compensation but the municipality asked for proof that his son was indeed hired for pit cleaning by the said employer the municipality claimed the young man had died because he was drunk i didn t have the energy money or time to fight it said mr narayanswamy since that day however he has kept a notebook with a neat list of names and addresses of people who call him for work if the police ask me for proof that i do this work i will show them this he said he also quit drinking a harder decision for pit cleaners than most can imagine mr munisamy katappa a 70 year old worker in mr narayanswamy s neighbourhood said i drink so that i can endure the horrid stink of excrement and the disgust and humiliation i feel he nursed a swollen hand that had been cut by a piece of glass in a toilet chamber some weeks ago many like him also work at night to avoid neighbours objections or ugly abuses these common practices exacerbate the risk of accidents in 2019 alone even as india expanded a nationwide clean india mission to end open defecation build toilets for homes in poor areas and mechanise sewage cleaning 110 people died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the past decade the average toll has been one or two each week killed by toxic fumes and accidents in slippery manholes despite stringent provisions few police complaints are filed when a manual scavenger dies and employers who illegally force workers to climb into sewers often go scot free if employers force us to work without safety gear or go inside a manhole we are helpless mr munisamy said india introduced rehabilitation packages and skills training workshops in 2013 to manual scavengers who wanted to quit one time cash assistance of 40 000 rupees and loans of up to 1 5 million rupees at low interest last year the indian government also launched the safaimitra suraksha challenge which aims to completely mechanise all septic and sewage tank cleaning operations in 243 cities across india by the end of this month but these policies have had little impact on the ground the government gives the families of the manual scavengers 1 million rupees if they die at work but what use is that for them and their children to survive the government should give them 5 million rupees and a decent job said mrs shakuntalamma a social worker with the safai karamchari kavalu samiti a committee that monitors manual scavenging in karnataka if the workers are illiterate at least give jobs and a loan to their children that would bring real change instead we see no rehabilitation and every day people die in the sewers of the 87 913 manual scavengers identified in a 2018 survey in 14 towns for instance only 27 268 received any form of help from the social justice ministry in charge of the rehabilitation programme activists say the programme is made redundant by too much bureaucracy and corruption at a union meeting in february in bangalore dozens of experienced sanitation workers who qualified for the state rehabilitation package said they had found the paperwork daunting first people left my grandfather no option but to clean their excrement and then they said they won t touch us because we re dirty we all have the same blood eat the same food i wish people would see human ability and not box us in by caste ms nagendrappa said manual scavenging is largely fuelled by individuals and private businesses and that the government uses only mechanised cleaning equipment but the sanitation workers said the government cannot absolve itself of responsibility they asked why they were not included in the nationwide shift to mechanised sewer cleaning the sewage department trained us one year ago to operate the jet cleaner but when residents call them for a cleaning they rarely take us along private contractors who own the machines employ their own set of workers explained one worker it is no surprise that many manual scavengers pin all their hopes on their children my kids and grandchildren should be educated so they get other job opportunities that is my wish said mr munisamy his granddaughter
