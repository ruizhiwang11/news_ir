angela goh however part of their final examinations was spent in a food pilot plant chopping ginger and dicing garlic mashing and blending turmeric and lemongrass into 48 different formulations of laksa paste as students in the food technology degree programme offered jointly by the singapore institute of technology sit and massey university their final trimester project was to reverse engineer a ready to eat laksa fried rice to achieve a similar taste as the market product from one of singapore s leading manufacturers true to the university s emphasis on applied learning every sit student gets the opportunity to immerse themselves in experiential and authentic learning environments students in the food technology programme are no exception each student is first furnished with theoretical knowledge such as in the chemical energetics engineering mathematics and industrial microbiology modules which covers the fundamental processes of food science practical modules also make up a large proportion of the curriculum modules such as fluid flow and technology and food chemistry allow students to experience sit s well equipped labs taking them from chemistry textbook to centrifuge to the goh sisters this practicum oriented approach has been invaluable we were given a lot of hands on practical sessions in the university said angela the exposure to industry standard practices equipment and machines was definitely beneficial for us in the labs we were working with equipment that we would be using in the real world this really helped us acclimatise to the working world immediately after graduating the crown jewel of the sit curriculum is without question the integrated work study programme iwsp a distinctive feature of sit s applied learning pedagogy the iwsp is a compulsory work attachment in which students undertake paid employment within their assigned company giving them the threefold advantage of simultaneously developing professional competencies professional networks and interpersonal skills during their iwsp each student is tasked to solve an industry specific problem angeline for instance was assigned to a flavour house which focuses on the research and development of carbonated beverages her task was to discern the optimal temperature and pressure setting of the lab scale carbonator to minimise the loss of fizz in a soft drink angela meanwhile was tasked to tackle a sensory problem to maintain the creaminess mouthfeel and flavour of milk by adjusting protein and fat combinations for the goh sisters this applied learning approach not only gave them the opportunity to apply their classroom and laboratory knowledge in real life situations but also furthered their interest in food technology it really puts you in the right mindset for the working world hear from angela and angeline themselves on their lives as sitizens true enough the twins were offered full time employment even before graduation angeline is now a food technologist at prima limited meanwhile angela is a research engineer at foodplant pte ltd a subsidiary of sit offering small batch food production these are just two of the myriad prospects available to the goh sisters they can readily step into the shoes of food technologists quality assurance officers and product development specialists to name just a few as the world grapples with issues of food security and singapore continues to expand its foodtech and agtech agriculture technology ecosystems graduates in food technology may see greater opportunities in the coming years in keeping with a truly holistic approach sit also offers plenty of opportunities for students to develop leadership and interpersonal skills despite being an introvert angela ended up as the captain of the tchoukball team an experience that she credits as being crucial to her growth as a leader i don t really like to speak up so leading a team can be quite difficult she said but when you assume a leadership role you have to be in control be authoritative be outspoken spurred by this experience angela went on to expand her horizons by joining the organising committee for the sit inter cluster games a huge event that saw alumni students and faculty compete against each other in sports such as pool badminton and e sports i learnt to move forward and work on whatever opportunities that were given to me she said as angeline shared one of the sit dna traits is to be able to learn unlearn and relearn here at sit we learn how to unlearn the temptation of sticking to the status quo we always

        "content": "in the third of a four part series on the changing role of universities oecd's education chief andreas schleicher talks to the straits times' senior education correspondent sandra davie on how universities have to evolve to stay relevant for some time now people have been questioning the value of universities the challenge became more robust in the last two years as the covid 19 pandemic hit and universities began to deliver their programmes online said a global education expert mr andreas schleicher director for education and skills at the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd stressed that universities have to make changes or they may lose the monopoly they have on providing higher education and accreditation for workers to access higher level jobs he said in an interview with the straits times when covid 19 hit and universities went online students and their parents asked if they should pay tens of thousands of dollars in fees to attend lessons online students go to university to learn from great professors do ground breaking research collaborate with their peers on projects and experience the social life of campus living it won't do to just offer a bunch of courses and give them a qualification at the end of the course he applauded singapore's management of the pandemic and how the local universities went back to providing on campus learning with safety management measures in place that has not been the case in many countries around the world unless they change universities will see even more students switching to alternative higher education providers who run courses and certify competencies for skills in demand it's already happening in some fields such as computing with tech companies he said adding that universities have to prepare for a world where their location or reputations will become less important what will matter to learners are programmes that will help them access the jobs they aspire to a in a world faced with constant change front loaded learning the current model of studying four years for a degree and then going out to build a career will not work any more we have to keep learning while earning you have to keep going back to relearn and reskill as you have to adapt constantly and pivot and change jobs continuing education will be done in many different places and many different ways both online and offline on campus and at the workplace universities have to adapt to the new ways in which their students will prefer to learn if not they will lose their position as main providers of higher education as i always say we designed our education systems including higher education very much in the industrial age when the objective was conformity and compliance with the established wisdom of our times it will not do in tomorrow's world where we need to create more environments where students can explore where they can take risks and try out new ideas a teacher or professor will be more of a coach a mentor a facilitator a designer of innovative learning environments you can see many good innovative programmes some being tried out by well established universities we must enable more of these new ideas to flourish in education a knowledge and skills acquired in education risk becoming quickly outdated in an age where knowledge grows exponentially and job market expectations are rapidly shifting in a world where shocks like pandemics and extreme weather events owing to climate change social unrest and political polarisation are expected to be more frequent we must prepare young people to adjust and adapt to quick unexpected disruptions and changes as far as jobs go universities need to stop preparing young people for the jobs that existed a generation ago study the broad changes and trends and prepare their young students for jobs which do not yet exist faculty should not just be focused on giving their students deep conceptual understanding of a field what is just as important is fostering the ability of young people to apply the knowledge they have accumulated in new situations in this way we give them the confidence to deal with the unfamiliar i feel entrepreneurship education is much more important now than it was a generation ago because it teaches those skills and personal attributes which are important to the modern labour market the art of being enterprising solution focused attitudes spotting opportunities and dealing with uncertainties all these will enable young people to identify and seize future opportunities a conventionally our approach to problems was to break them down into manageable bits and pieces confined to narrow disciplines and then to teach students the techniques to solve them today however knowledge advances by synthesising different fields of knowledge making connections between ideas that previously seemed unrelated it demands open mindedness making connections between ideas that seem unrelated and becoming familiar with knowledge in other fields a i don't think we have much choice if we want our students to develop as individuals if we want to live in harmony with the planet i don't think we have much choice but to pay attention to building this guidance system by that i mean nurturing in students that kind of compass that helps them to be open and appreciate the different ways of thinking it's not just listening to the words of other people but you need to be able to develop that sense of empathy towards others and not just at the individual level to a specific person but also to other cultures our societies were always most successful when we did that well think about the renaissance period where people from all walks of life came together to build great things that openness is absolutely central to societies succeeding i think this is really the central role of education mr andreas schleicher 57 is director for education and skills and special adviser on education policy to the secretary general at the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd in paris as a key member of the oecd senior management team mr schleicher supports the secretary general's strategy to produce analysis and policy advice that advances economic growth and social progress he also promotes the work of the directorate for education and skills

        "content": "singapore in the second of a five week askst series on university education the straits times addresses questions on specialised degrees a i understand your concern about overspecialising in a field after all people are experiencing rapid change and disruptions and the pace is only going to get faster thanks to advances in fields such as computing robotics and artificial intelligence several reports on job trends have warned that in many industries the most in demand occupations or specialities currently did not exist 10 or even five years ago and they say the pace of change is set to accelerate even more people cannot think of degrees as lifelong stamps of professional competency such thinking creates a false sense of security perpetuating the illusion that work and the knowledge and skills required is static fortunately universities around the world including singapore's institutions have moved away from such thinking and changed their curricula and the way they prepare their students to ensure that they are able to adapt to changes the singapore institute of technology sit offers many specialised degrees including the ones you are interested in cyber security and software engineering these degrees are popular partly because of the good job prospects they offer with cyber security risks becoming more sophisticated there is an acute shortage of cyber security specialists who can be engaged to help fend off such threats similarly software engineers are increasingly sought after as every aspect of people's lives is touched by technology at home in schools and in the workplace sit graduates in information security in 2020 earned a median monthly salary of 4 300 up from 4 100 the year before while ict software engineering graduates earned a median salary of 4 000 their employers were a good mix of local small and medium sized enterprises government agencies and multinational companies such as govtech singapore accenture temus and the defence science and technology agency so how does sit do it university officials say their graduates are able to hit the ground running partly because of the institution's emphasis on hands on real world learning first the university maintains close contact with industry leaders in each degree course's relevant sector and involves them in shaping the curricula this enables the faculty to uncover emerging industry trends and gaps in skills quickly and tweak the courses in computing for example there are courses that are co designed and co delivered by sit faculty and industry partners from firms such as group ib and dell technologies cyber security students benefited from guest lectures provided by industry partners and had lessons where they role played hackers attacking sit's network or the tech team defending the system all sit programmes require students to take up an eight to 12 month attachment under the integrated work study programme this is a distinctive feature of the university's curriculum students apply and go for interviews to undertake paid jobs within companies relevant to their programmes the attachments enable them to gain an understanding of the jobs and industries they may be working in as well as develop important work skills including teamwork innovative thinking and problem solving sit students get to work on authentic industry projects throughout their studies in their penultimate and final years of studies they carry out their capstone and final year projects in partnership with the companies where they do their work attachments for example software engineering students developed a mobile app for doctors at the neonatal intensive care unit at the national university hospital addressing concerns about specialised degrees becoming outdated deputy president academic and provost professor john thong said that even though sit students undertake specialised or niche degrees their learning is not confined to just those fields sit ensures that its students pick up interdisciplinary and transferable skills to navigate multiple careers in an uncertain future for example students undertake a sequence of modules such as critical thinking and communication and design innovation using a project based learning approach student teams drawn from different programmes have to come up with solutions to complex problems keeping economic environmental social political ethical health safety and sustainability factors in mind there is also a social innovation project where multidisciplinary student teams put their skills into practice while leveraging their disciplinary expertise the university is also launching the industry ready skills framework when the academic year starts in september to help students keep track of the transferable skills they have acquired over the course of their studies the skills ranging from creative thinking and problem solving to digital data literacy and self management will be embedded into the formal curriculum with the levels of skills attained to be explicitly stated skills acquired through activities outside of the formal curriculum are also taken into account of course another key way to guard against your knowledge and skills becoming outdated is to pursue lifelong learning sit is a strong proponent of that it has always stressed that after four years its students will have the sit dna which is the ability and commitment to continually learn unlearn and relearn to keep up with the changes an example of an sit graduate who successfully pivoted to another field thanks to his training at sit is mr bhati yash 26 for mr yash who graduated with a degree in hospitality business in 2020 finding a job was initially challenging because of the bleak outlook facing the hospitality industry so he switched to searching for jobs in it project management and secured a traineeship for six months at singtel doing project management and fintech business planning in its business analytics team now a business analyst at technology company the software practice mr yash credits his education at sit for enabling him to make the switch to it project management while he was at sit he picked up valuable it skills during an eight month work attachment at the marina bay sands integrated resort he also gained project management experience while juggling multiple projects during his degree studies as well as through joining competitions such as the singapore tourism board's tourism innovation challenge where his

which are then assigned by the international civil aviation organisation icao to different countries to manage singapore's fir currently overlaps parts of indonesia's airspace and singapore has been managing flights in these areas since 1946 prof tan said the exercise of air traffic control responsibilities is an icao approved exercise of administrative responsibilities and does not affect or compromise the sovereign status of another country's airspace he added this is a regular phenomenon worldwide where the fir of one country commonly overlaps with the sovereign airspace of others that said the singapore fir has long irked politicians in neighbouring countries since flights in their own airspace requires coordination with singapore air traffic control the new arrangement should thus be seen as a stabilising solution to calm such bilateral irritations associate professor leonard sebastian from the s rajaratnam school of international studies rsis at nanyang technological university agreed the overall result was beneficial for singapore as it would retain its importance and relevance as an aviation hub in the region singapore will continue to regulate the entry and exit of flights to and from changi airport said prof sebastian who is coordinator of the indonesia programme at rsis he noted that the agreement sets a new tone with both countries performing a co managing role over the airspace indonesia will also deploy personnel to singapore to work with air traffic controllers under the pact and this will reduce noise and friction at the operational level in the long run he noted in the other agreements singapore and indonesia concluded a treaty that will allow for the extradition of fugitives to indonesia and signed a defence cooperation agreement dca on military training and exercises in indonesia the issue of extradition has also been a sticking point for jakarta which has been keen to bring back wealthy indonesians alleged to have embezzled large sums of money the extradition treaty was first signed in 2007 along with the dca but was never ratified as lawmakers opposing then president susilo bambang yudhoyono had blocked the latter prof sebastian noting that there are no significant changes to the extradition treaty and the defence agreement said conditions for ratification at this time would be more favourable given the presence of a large pro jokowi coalition of parties in parliament even so he cautioned it was too early to conclude that the process will be smooth sailing since political dynamics in indonesia involve a wide variety of views and interest groups on the signing of the three agreements prof sebastian said it constitutes a commitment of both countries to strengthen bilateral ties he added more significantly

        "content": "singapore the public accounts committee pac a parliamentary watchdog consisting of eight mps on wednesday jan 26 released detailed observations from its review of the public sector report by the auditor general's office ago for the financial year 2020 2021 the committee recognised that public sector agencies took the ago's findings seriously and have implemented improvement measures said the pac it asked individual agencies to address causes of their lapses and detail the follow up actions taken these are the highlights of the pac's findings the ago had flagged weak controls over user accounts that had full access to the operating system of acra's online filing and information retrieval system bizfile the ministry of finance informed the pac that the root causes were oversight by an acra officer the authority's vendor not following procedural controls and software incompatibility issues going forward acra will emphasise the ago's findings in staff training programmes and incorporate advisories into compliance checklists among other measures about 341 000 fitness trackers not put to use for the hpb's national steps challenge resulted in 5 39 million of public funds being wasted some of the units had become mouldy and the warranties for all the excess trackers had expired at the end of 2021 the ministry of health told the pac that hpb had over estimated demand for the trackers and pre emptively topped up its stock obsolete or faulty trackers have since been disposed of while the working ones have either been used to replace and exchange for faulty trackers and those with expired warranties or to support various companies in their health initiatives moving forward hpb will adopt smaller batches of initial and top up buys and monitor demand on a real time basis it has also started daily accounting for trackers at various distribution points and will conduct a full stock count bi annually responding to the ago's findings about lapses in the management of hpb's loyalty programme between april 2018 and june 2020 the statutory board said it took action to claw back the rewards from those who had made improper redemptions some 6 300 worth of rewards had been paid for by hpb out of 14 900 worth of health points accumulated by 594 accounts belonging to people who have died the board also lodged a police report over the fraudulent accounts which have been frozen hpb is exploring the integration of singpass data for authentication and verification by the end of this year the ago had found that hsa had been buying required items like chemicals laboratory devices and consumables on an ad hoc basis instead of aggregating its requirements and purchasing them through tenders the authority's total expenditure on small value purchases between april 2018 and june 2020 was substantial at 8 02 million there were also lapses in its outsourced it contracts and it application controls hsa has since established period contracts or framework agreements where feasible tightened processes stepped up controls and checks and instituted proficiency courses and briefings for both staff and outsourced vendors housing grants totalling 405 000 were disbursed to ineligible applicants and the ago had found that quotations for some items could have been created or altered to give the impression that they were obtained from other suppliers hdb has since recovered grants disbursed to ineligible applicants verified those who were eligible or correctly assessed for their grants and requested additional documents from others one applicant could not be contacted as at the end of last year other steps taken by hdb include the establishment of procedures on income assessment and automated checks on declarations and eligibility where possible by march this year for the irregularities in quotations the root cause according to the ministry of national development was a supervisory lapse on the part of consultants and hdb staff a police report has been made and a demerit point system implemented to guard against any future lapses in diligence among various measures the ago found several lapses and errors in a 430 000 tender for event and venue management services for a 2018 mpa event the mpa officer in charge had also engaged in detailed discussions with the tenderer that was later awarded the contract before the tender approving authority had made a decision the transport ministry told the pac that a panel of investigation was appointed to scrutinise the past three years of tenders handled by the same project team action will be taken against officers found accountable for weak supervision and leadership and poor quality staff work among other issues mpa has committed to improving both staff training and procurement policies and procedures through manuals briefings centralised processes and other initiatives the ago had called for improvements in both ministries' administration of facility management contracts it had found supporting documents created or backdated to satisfy ago's queries and weaknesses in mha's integrated logistics management system both ministries eventually made police reports on the possible fabrication or falsification of records moe and mha told the pac that their lapses were due to people and process factors including inadequate monitoring poor or complete lack of documentation and overly prescriptive specifications among other reasons both ministries said they would strengthen oversight and step up checks moe has held the relevant managing agents accountable while rectifying overpayments and underpayments made it has also rolled out a mobile app for school personnel to report facility management related faults for mha a task force was set up in june last year to propose enhancements to processes and map out training and learning opportunities for officers the nac had been found to have lapsed in the rental management of its 37 arts housing premises with 74 non tenants using its spaces for activities unrelated to the arts the pac was told that nac was aware and supportive of tenants co locating closely related entities at the sites as these entities help sustain and complement the main art practice but there was no formal process to approve such entities nac has since cleaned up these entities issued a circular in july last year on the need to seek official approval and instituted annual checks the nhb had lapsed in record keeping and tender approval with heritage items missing bids not evaluated and purchases often made from the most expensive option the ministry of culture community and youth mccy told the pac that limitations in it systems were the root cause with some parts of nhb still manually maintaining records physical objects have since been properly accounted for records updated and operating procedures improved nhb also engaged an external consultant in september 2019 to streamline its processes and plans to upgrade its infrastructure for tagging and stock taking by the end of fy2024 the lapses in tender evaluation were attributed to inexperienced procurement staff nhb has since set up a workgroup to improve future tenders and established new procurement training and process frameworks the ago had found lapses in nlb's procurement of a digital film projection system worth 4 75 million there was inadequate assurance that principles of value for money fairness and transparency had been adhered to the pac was told by the ministry of communications and information mci that the nlb had formed an internal review panel and identified weaknesses in duty of care on the part of officers involved in procurement on top of gaps in certain stages of the procurement process nlb has also stepped up briefings guidance and training for its officers while strengthening its processes and identification of conflict of interest among other improvements the pa's management of two large development projects our tampines hub and heartbeat bedok had been flagged by the ago for lapses and possible irregularities it led to the pa making a police report and suspending staff who may have falsified quotations and doctored documents the pac was informed that staff oversight was mainly to blame along with external consultants' lack of familiarity with government regulations price fluctuations in contracts have been revised and standardised contract variations reviewed and various processes formalised mccy told the pac among other measures a task force has been set up to strengthen governance of our tampines hub and internal audit checks stepped up across all development projects starting from april 2022 more than 9 000 possible erroneous medical and dental claims paid to ineligible officers or pensioners over a period of more than two years were administered by the psd resulting in the possible overpayment of around 500 000 psd told the pac the lapses could be attributed to systems and records not being fully synchronised as well as human error human resource and payroll systems will be enhanced to automate updating and include controls to flag anomalies psd will also step up efforts to educate and train officers and perform regular post payment analytics on claims the psd and accountant general's department will look into the specific erroneous claims flagged by the ago for those which might suggest an intent to game the system officers would be asked to explain and account for the claims and stern action would be taken if there were attempts to be dishonest the committee noted in its report sp did not put up the required reports concerning two tenderers who had withdrawn their bids before the awarding of the tender the ago had called such withdrawals a serious matter and grounds for debarment from being awarded government tenders for a period of time moe told the pac that the relevant sp officer had been unaware of the procurement debarment rules which had inadvertently not been communicated to finance officers the polytechnic instituted a new process from july last year where the office of the

        "content": "singapore parliament's public sector accounts watchdog has raised the possibility of the government shifting from a just in time operating model to a just in case one in view of the impact of disruptions to the global supply chain arising from the covid 19 pandemic the impact of the public sector permanently adopting hybrid working arrangements was also a point of concern for the public accounts committee pac which comprises eight mps these observations were released in a report on wednesday jan 26 along with responses from relevant government agencies other broad issues discussed by the pac along with their impact on public sector spending financial governance and control included the need to re evaluate baseline spending as singapore moves to become a covid resilient nation as well as the need for a proper governance framework for the singapore green plan a national movement for sustainable development the committee said it was concerned about how disruptions to the global supply chain would impact costs for the government given the need to shift its approach from just in time where costs are reduced by keeping inventories lean to just in case where buffers and stockpiles would become the new planning parameters as pac chairman foo mee har noted the other members of the committee are mps cheryl chan louis chua derrick goh henry kwek poh li san saktiandi supaat and tan wu meng the committee said it was concerned about how disruptions to the global supply chain would impact costs for the government apart from supply chain concerns other new inflationary risks and vulnerabilities would affect government spending and may require adjustments to financial governance processes and internal controls the pac added in response the ministry of finance mof pointed to four strategies it has in place building a strong buffer of financial resources diversifying sources of supplies considering the establishment of commercially viable local production sources for certain supplies and stockpiling essential supplies the ministry said that as an example it is encouraging agencies to use a combination of fiscal and non fiscal regulatory measures to enhance resilience while exploring if costs could be shared with other stakeholders mof said that when calibrating the level of government spending it will consider the effects of inflation and also the macroeconomic impact of the government spending in itself the ministry also works with agencies to ensure forward planning diversification of supply and the development of contingency plans when it comes to essential goods and industrial supplies the government would likely play a more direct role to ensure food supply resilience as the market would not naturally provide for an adequate level of resilience said mof on the other hand industrial supply chain disruptions are commercial risks which should be mainly addressed by companies with limited government involvement if at all another area the pac was concerned about was the attendant risks and impact on governance controls oversight and accountability with greater adoption of work from home and hybrid arrangements in the public sector to this the public service division psd said that even as it shifts towards hybrid work settings where telecommuting becomes a permanent feature it has put in place measures to ensure citizens and businesses can continue to access services seamlessly and service standards to ensure feedback is reviewed in a timely fashion psd will develop a set of principles stating that hybrid work is not an entitlement job requirements take priority and hybrid work provisions can be varied depending on the workforce's readiness for instance new hires may not be able to work from home as much at the beginning psd said public service officers may also be reskilled to mitigate any disruption to their jobs due to hybrid work arrangements personal assistants for one could take on additional roles in coordination or knowledge or event management while counter staff could manage live chats or attend to citizens via video conferencing psd also has a strategy to look after employee well being be it overwork from the blurring of lines between the home and the office or feelings of social isolation this includes a central counselling hotline regular webinars and a community of appointed wellness ambassadors to address telecommuting related cyber security risks public officers have also been informed of best practices and measures to secure their home network for example they also need to go through annual cyber security awareness training while all agencies are required to conduct audits on their information and communications technology systems join st's

        "content": "singapore singapore faces foreseeable challenges such as climate change and the possible fragmentation of society as well as unpredictable challenges like future pandemics in the years ahead and will need to plan for greater flexibility in the city said minister for national development desmond lee this may mean safeguarding more land for future use instead of maximising all the available resources now and would require balancing competing interests across time and space in such situations where there are no perfect solutions and people must make tough compromises singaporeans will need to trust that decisions made are in their best shared interests after all the different views have been heard he added at the institute of policy studies' singapore perspectives 2022 conference on monday jan 24 it was held at the sands expo and convention centre at marina bay sands and streamed online mr lee was sharing his vision of what singapore might look like in the years ahead and what is needed for the country to get there trust was one of the elements he highlighted alongside stewardship and collective action as a city state and the only one worldwide that is responsible for defence foreign affairs and other aspects associated with full sovereignty singapore must fit everything that a sovereign country needs within its city limits of 730 sq km this is our burden to bear but it is also our calling and our opportunity and it pushes us to keep finding better ways to make the most of what we have he said of singapore's intense land use pressures thus city planning is not just a technical professional or infrastructural process he added it is a sociopolitical process it's about nurturing our society and becoming the nation that we aspire to be to this end singapore has started to prepare for uncertainties that could arise from climate change societal polarisation population ageing city maintenance and land use pressures he said for instance the country has committed to raise its land and construct sea walls and polders to keep out the sea in a major investment and act of faith that could cost some 100 billion or more over the next 50 or 100 years he said with societies around the world becoming more polarised along race religion socioeconomic status or political ideologies singapore has also put in place measures to encourage interaction among people of different backgrounds such as launching a new model for public housing in prime locations that also includes public rental flats he added meanwhile as the population ages the housing board hdb has started to pilot a new type of flat that integrates senior friendly housing with care services communal spaces and programmes so seniors can age in place amid these developments the city will also grow old and singapore is working hard to guard against urban decay said mr lee he noted that older cities have learnt hard lessons when neglected roads and highways gave rise to more accidents and buildings in disrepair became safety hazards and hot spots for crime to avoid this singapore will upgrade hdb flats as they age to keep them in good condition with two rounds of the home improvement programme for each flat once when the flat is 30 years old and another when it is about 60 to 70 years old mr lee also pledged to keep in good condition and refresh older buildings that form important parts of the collective heritage saying this way the future of our city remains connected with our past with our memories he also noted the pressures on land use with the need for more housing space as the society's aspirations evolve he pointed to how demand for housing has risen recently partly because children of the baby boomers born in the 80s and 90s are starting their own families and partly because of changes in social structures and aspirations that have led to smaller households and children preferring to strike out on their own aside from these uncertainties there is also a need to prepare for unknown unknowns such as crises like the covid 19 pandemic he said referring to unpredictable risks this will require planning for different possibilities and greater flexibility including safeguarding more land to stockpile and produce essential materials during supply disruptions and setting aside flexible white space for emergency use this may mean that we can't maximise all our available land now but it will help us to build resilience for future challenges he said sketching out a future singapore that is close knit climate ready celebrates diversity makes space for differences and brings people together in common spaces mr lee said trust stewardship and collective action are necessary to achieve this vision on trust he said when we share our views do we trust that we will be heard do we trust that those who disagree with us love this city as much as we do so that we can try to find common ground he added trust doesn't mean we always have to agree but it means we must believe that despite our disagreements we always have the interests of our city at heart fostering this takes hard work there'll be stumbles along the way and it only comes with building deep relationships over time next with land so scarce it is critical to steward it with care as singapore's forefathers did for the current generation he said this means thinking long term because our city is not just for us but for our children and their children to come added mr lee pointing to how earlier generations had set aside swathes of land that are being used for bold urban transformation plans such as the greater southern waterfront the jurong lake district and the paya lebar air base when it is relocated as these plans are realised they will create new and interesting spaces for the next generation who will in turn pursue their own rejuvenation plans and shape this city in the vision that they aspire lastly mr lee called on singaporeans to take collective action roll up our sleeves and work together all of us have a part to play in the future for our society and city state he said we only have one city and we must make the most of it now and in the future

        "content": "singapore one of the best moves by israel in the coronavirus pandemic was acting rapidly even before all the data had emerged said its ambassador to singapore mr sagi karni and yet much of its effort has been undermined by anti vaxxers and by people not complying with safety measures its safest citizens are those who have taken booster vaccine shots said an israeli medical expert on its part the israeli government had left no stone unturned mr karni highlighted how it closed its borders in march 2020 before the world health organisation declared the pandemic and again for four weeks when the new omicron variant emerged to slow down the entry of the virus israel was also at the forefront of vaccine efforts starting a mass mrna vaccination campaign in december 2020 it was the first country to give booster shots last year in january this year it started giving seniors and at risk people younger people with underlying medical conditions for example a second booster shot this has reduced the number of deaths but israel would have fared even better if so many had not opted to stay unvaccinated relative to singapore its casualties are high more than 8 700 people out of israel's 9 3 million population have died from covid 19 or 936 deaths per million population in singapore where the disease has killed 854 people the rate is 144 per million population the worst casualty rate is in peru where more than 6 000 people per million have died the united states belgium italy britain and russia have all suffered more than 2 000 covid 19 deaths per million population ambassador karni pointed to the unvaccinated who account for about a third of israel's population noting of people in intensive care the vast majority are unvaccinated or have medical problems about 64 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated with 4 4 million people or nearly half the population with at least three mrna shots this is far lower than the 88 per cent of singapore's population who are fully vaccinated and 56 per cent with booster shots mr karni said the anti vaxxer group is very vocal in israel there was a demonstration in tel aviv in summer last year accusing the government of experimenting with human lives they were using megaphones and giving out brochures although almost a third of israelis are not vaccinated mr karni said israel is not timid and has opened up its borders to vaccinated travellers who test on arrival and has reduced the quarantine period from 10 to seven days too many people in quarantine will hurt the economy he said dr boaz lev who heads the advisory panel to israel's ministry of health told the straits times in a video call that booster shots have cut the number of severe illness and deaths in israel he said protection from having just two shots of the mrna vaccine is tremendously low hospital rates are much higher than for those who have had three or four shots those who are severely ill are mostly those who have not been vaccinated or vaccinated not more than two times he added those who received their second jab at least 28 weeks back are considered vaccinated without validity in israel the second booster shot given to people 60 years and older and to those 18 years and older with underlying medical conditions pushes up protection by three to five times he said but he added i've had four shots of mrna but i still got omicron luckily it was mild on whether protection from the booster shot would start to wane after about four months like with the earlier shots he said ask me that in five months some experts worry that giving vaccines too frequently could result in a lower immune response dr lev said sometimes our answers have to be short term we have a strong omicron wave on our hands and the benefits outweigh the risks we assess the side effects to be comparable to the first three shots omicron moved so fast people deserve the extra protection getting a second booster shot more than triples their protection against infection he said the omicron wave is peaking in israel and that he expects numbers to go down within the month infections hit a high of more than 83 000 on jan 23 and are now hovering around 60 000 new cases a day although omicron is six times less severe than the delta variant in causing illness dr lev said severe illness and deaths always lag behind infection but there is some concern that maybe once the omicron wave declines there might be another surge of delta which causes more severe illness said dr lev about 91 per cent of infections in israel today are caused by omicron mr karni praised singapore for doing extremely well in keeping deaths low attributing it to the country having one of the highest vaccination rates in the world as well as a supportive population nobody is happy to wear masks in this hot weather but people do it he said compliance in israel is not as good dr lev agreed distancing is important but difficult to maintain in israel wearing of masks is not enforced in a strict manner israelis are not very obedient join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles

        "content": "singapore mr mohamed sharil sham used to enjoy playing soccer running and taking yearly trips overseas but these are now distant memories for the minibus driver for even though he is only 37 years old he has trouble standing up on his own the result of end stage chronic kidney disease my legs are very very weak when i go up a kerb i have to get someone to help me balance mr sharil who has been on dialysis for about 1 years told the straits times on wednesday jan 26 dr behram ali khan medical director of the national kidney foundation nkf said that there has been a worrying increase in patients with chronic kidney disease here in recent years a person is said to have this condition when they have had kidney disease for more than three months he said in singapore this is typically the result of hypertension diabetes or a combination of the two both of these conditions are very prevalent in singapore said dr behram adding that based on several studies about two out of three singaporeans are at risk of developing chronic kidney disease in their lifetime there is a continuous and progressive trend of more patients entering dialysis every year he said noting that the nkf has been seeing more than 100 applications for admission every month up from about 60 a month a few years ago associate professor jimmy teo head and senior consultant at the division of nephrology in national university hospital said he has also seen more patients referred for kidney disease in recent years referring to the singapore renal registry annual report 2019 which was published in mid 2021 prof teo pointed out that the number of patients on definitive dialysis here had almost doubled from 741 in 2010 to 1 202 in 2019 if you have the same number of doctors and nurses and facilities you cannot cope with that if it comes in a big wave then that's when you have a big problem which is essentially where we're at now at the cusp or seeing the early part of it said prof teo dr behram who is also visiting consultant at nuh's division of nephrology said there are a number of factors that could lead to someone developing chronic kidney disease these include genetic predispositions being overweight a sedentary lifestyle diet smoking and old age prof teo said that singapore's ageing population combined with greater screening efforts could be behind the rising number of patients in recent years in the case of mr sharil his condition was the result of a love for sugary drinks in his younger days as well as a reluctance to seek help for nearly two decades after being diagnosed with diabetes in the late 1990s he did not get any professional treatment for his condition until 2020 as he was worried about the financial costs after diagnosis i went to national service and my salary was not that high i needed to give money to my family as well at the time i was young so i didn't think much of it i thought never mind sure can cure he said his condition worsened until one day in 2020 he realised he was so breathless that he could not walk or even lie down after going to the hospital he was told his lungs were full of fluid and his kidneys were no longer functioning how i wish i could turn back time i would take better care of myself said mr sharil dr behram said there are several ways to tackle chronic kidney disease including treating underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and high sugar a kidney transplant is the best option for those with kidney failure he added encouraging people to donate their kidneys as the waiting time for a kidney from a deceased donor here is very long dr behram said that lifestyle modifications are important too such as exercising more monitoring weight quitting smoking and eating better prof teo added that this includes avoiding added salt eating lots of fruits and vegetables and choosing whole grains this is to avoid overloading whatever kidney function is still intact such lifestyle modifications can also help to prevent chronic kidney disease from developing in the first place prof teo also said that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of patients with diagnosed kidney disease will need medication these include a new class of drugs known as sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitors or sglt 2 inhibitors such drugs block sugar and sodium from being reabsorbed by the kidney one particular drug dapagliflozin not only treats diabetes and reduces the progression of chronic kidney disease but also helps reduce blood pressure and treats heart failure said dr behram prof teo and dr behram both agreed that early screening and treatment are also critical in tackling the disease if you are above 30 and have any other risk factors like high blood pressure high blood sugar levels are overweight or have family members with kidney disease you should definitely get medically screened said dr behram prof teo said that identifying the disease early and preventing it from progressing is the most crucial task to focus on he added get treated earlier there are some breakthroughs in treatment that can significantly reduce the risk of end stage kidney failure you can make

pandemic local consumption however remained relatively constant imports of shark's fin climbed from 2 700 tonnes in 2017 to 3 000 tonnes in 2018 and 3 500 tonnes in 2019 spain namibia and taiwan were the top suppliers this slipped back down to 2 700 tonnes last year according to data from the singapore food agency sfa shark's fin exports also rose year on year till the pandemic struck rising from 2 400 tonnes in 2017 to 3 300 tonnes in 2019 pre covid local consumption which sfa derives by deducting the exported amount from imports dropped from 200 tonnes in 2017 to 100 tonnes in 2018 but rose again to 200 tonnes the following year all figures are rounded to the nearest hundreds and may not tally due to rounding based on trade data 2020 saw local consumption spike to 800 tonnes however it is incorrect to assume increased domestic consumption based on trade data said mr chester gan responsible seafood programme officer at world wide fund for nature wwf singapore he said the apparent spike in consumption could be due to trade disruptions from covid 19 for instance singapore traders could have imported significant volumes of shark fin for re export but were unable to do so due to supply chain issues however without in depth interviews and studies involving the stakeholders in the shark s fin supply chain we are unable to provide a definitive response he added importers and exporters as well as several restaurants contacted by the straits times have declined comment professor paul teng adjunct senior fellow at the s rajaratnam school of international studies at nanyang technological university said export quantity of shark's fin in 2020 has gone down from 2019's which is likely due to pandemic led supply chain issues as borders around the world shut as dried or canned shark's fin could last for several years if processed and stored properly it is possible that the 800 tonnes of shark's fin could still remain as inventory in singapore online shark's fin sellers told st that the shelf life of canned shark's fin is two years while frozen shark's fin can be kept for up to six months eating shark's fin a traditional chinese delicacy that is popular at banquets has become controversial in recent decades as the species was driven to endangerment and cruel practices of finning sharks that were tossed back alive to their certain death into the sea were exposed a 2017 report by wwf and traffic a wildlife trade monitoring network found that singapore is the world's second largest shark's fin trader by value after hong kong with imports standing at 65 million and exports at 50 4 million wwf and traffic said that singapore has an important part to play in tackling the crisis and urged the authorities to adopt stricter regulations the report set off a new round of discussions on shark's fin in singapore mr gan said trade in shark's fin is concerning as sharks are keystone species in many marine ecosystems they play a vital role in maintaining the equilibrium of these ecosystems and are essential to the well being of many coastal communities as well as the overall health of our oceans over the years many establishments in the food and hospitality industry have taken shark's fin and other shark products off their menus however some restaurants are still serving it as shark's fin soup or in pen cai which is a traditional chinese stew with layers of delicacy founder and chef of tonny restaurant chef tonny chan 60 said that the customers that ordered shark's fin dishes from him are regular customers and are usually in their 40s or older our customers will mostly order shark's fin dishes during chinese new year or birthdays because they want to have a feast he said in mandarin some children will also order shark's fin for their parents' birthdays as a treat he added mr chan said that he realised an increase in sales for shark's fin between 2020 and last year and attributed the reason to the ease of safe management measures to allow eight people to dine in however he expects sales to fall again this year with the five person group size limit owner of tasty loong restaurant chef pung lu tin 61 also said that customers who order shark's fin are usually aged 40 years and above he said in mandarin some of them have the habit of consuming shark's fin they may also have a more traditional way of thinking that there is a need to serve shark's fin when treating someone to a meal so that they look better others may also think that eating shark's fin is a way of enjoying a delicacy mr pung added that while some local companies will still order shark's fin when hosting guests most of the larger corporations have especially requested not to include shark's fin in the dishes that they ordered nowadays despite the continued demand a study conducted by wwf singapore and accenture in october 2020 showed that there is evidence of increasing support from the consumers to limit consumption of shark's fin with most people willing to support government legislation to decrease consumption and trade of the product mr gan added from our engagement with major hotels around shark's fin consumption many establishments

straits times visited six wet markets on wednesday jan 26 and found that chinese pomfret was selling for as high as 90 to 100 a kg up from 40 to 50 a kg last november red grouper was priced at up to 75 a kg from 30 to 40 a kg in november while the fish merchants association said the price increase is normal during the chinese new year period stallholders said the increase is exacerbated by floods in malaysia last month vendors added that suppliers in china have also been snatching up stocks singapore's fish supplies come mainly from malaysia indonesia and vietnam fishmonger michael yak 47 who runs a stall at tiong bahru market said the price increase can't be helped the floods in malaysia last month affected supply and quality most of the stocks were also bought up by china the other markets st visited were clementi 448 market and food centre toa payoh west market and food centre ghim moh road market and food centre tekka centre and chinatown complex a 70 year old stallholder at tekka centre who wanted to be known only as mrs yang raised the price of chinese pomfret from 30 a kg last month to the current 70 a kg she is selling red grouper at 45 a kg up from 30 before as supply is low customers must order these fish in advance she said walk in customers may not get what they want she added mr ang jwee herng president of the singapore fish merchants' general association said that the two types of fish are typically around 50 per cent more expensive in the lead up to chinese new year due to high demand these are the most popular types of fish during the chinese new year period so there's increased demand it isn't any different from previous years he said meanwhile fishmongers said the price of other fish like rabbitfish and marbled goby may fluctuate depending on their quality mr yak's prices for the two types of fish remained stable at 40 a kg but the price of rabbitfish dipped at bm seafood in ghim moh fishmonger lee kok weng 33 who works there said at the start of the month rabbitfish was 30 a kg because the quality was good but the stocks this week are quite normal so we lowered the price to 26 a kg the price of marbled goby at his stall remained the same at 45 a kg madam irene lim 64 a legal secretary who was shopping at ghim moh said i buy fish only during festive seasons so the price increase is acceptable to me especially when businesses at markets have been affected by the pandemic the price of prawns hovered at around 20 a kg a market vendor at toa payoh west was selling prawns at 25 a kg up from 20 a kg last month while a vendor at clementi was selling them at 20 a kg up from 15 a kg last month vegetable prices also continued to creep up mr jerry tan vice secretary of the singapore fruits and vegetables importers and exporters association noted that the lack of workers in malaysian farms meant that vegetable prices are prone to fluctuation he said it's harder to tell for vegetables like tang oh and chinese cabbage but tomatoes from malaysia are priced on the high side at the moment due to labour shortage some importers have turned to thailand for supplies about 64 per cent of the 80 434 tonnes of leafy vegetables singapore imported in 2020 came from malaysia with the rest coming mainly from china and thailand mr mic ng 42 who runs a vegetable stall at clementi increased the price of tomatoes from 2 50 to 3 50 a kg he said last month i already increased the price of tomatoes from 1 50 a kg to 2 50 now i have to raise prices again but it can't be helped stocks are still affected by the aftermath of the floods in malaysia and manpower issues mr ng also raised prices of other vegetables like spinach and chinese cabbage by between 50 cents and 3 a kg madam tan ah sim 63 who runs a vegetable stall at ghim moh with her husband increased the price of tang oh from 8 a kg last week to the current 10 a kg she is selling spinach at 10 a kg now up from 7 last week business is bad and we're quite stressed there are fewer customers compared with last chinese new year and our profit margin is not a lot she said but a 75 year old stallholder at tiong bahru who wanted to be known only as madam goh said she did not raise the prices of all her vegetables despite suppliers increasing prices by 30 per cent madam goh is selling spinach at 8 a kg tomatoes at 3 50 a kg and long beans at 5 a kg we absorbed the costs because if we were to increase no one would buy she said a spokesman for supermarket chain sheng siong said on wednesday that the price of chinese pomfret and red grouper increased by 10 per cent to 15 per cent due to high demand we have kept the prices for most of the seafood items stable she said adding that weather conditions affected supply vegetable prices have also increased due to higher freight and labour costs but the spokesman said it will be offering attractive promotions during the festive period a fairprice spokesman added that prices of seafood and vegetables have generally remained stable but the price of chinese pomfret and red grouper increased by about 15 per cent it will continue to diversify sources for fresh produce by working with local farms and overseas suppliers a spokesman for dfi retail group which runs giant said that sales of giant s lower prices that last range increased by 50 per cent over the last four weeks the range includes fish like golden pomfret which is going for two for 6 and vegetables like chye sim and round spinach which is sold at 2 for any three types the spokesman did not elaborate on overall prices

        "content": "singapore the thriving online trade and growing appetite for two seafood items fish maw and sea cucumber in singapore and malaysia are threatening their population in the wild warned a wildlife trade monitoring organisation notably several threatened and internationally regulated species including those protected under singapore and malaysia laws are being sold online said non governmental organisation traffic in a report released on friday jan 28 the report which is calling for more stringent monitoring of the trade in the two marine delicacies had tracked advertisements and listings for those products online over 11 days in 2020 it then returned to the sites on jan 14 this year and found that trade was still active and in fact included species not offered in 2020 among the sites monitored by traffic were singapore based e commerce and seafood websites such as carousell shopee lazada song fish dealer and natural brand between june 17 and july 6 in 2020 33 online sites from both countries had numerous listings offering at least 5 540kg of sea cucumber and fish maw products altogether sellers on online trading platforms tradekey singapore and tradekey malaysia claimed they could supply 4 100kg of sea cucumber with 2 300kg on a monthly basis and 100kg on a weekly basis the report highlighted the volumes of sea cucumber and fish maw seen in the online trade in malaysia and singapore are large however the actual volume of trade is much higher than what was recorded during the assessment said ms kanitha krishnasamy director for traffic in south east asia we know this not just because these products are widely available in outlets but some online sellers also claimed they were able to supply large amounts on a monthly basis fish maw and sea cucumber are two of the four traditional seafood delicacies widely enjoyed in asia alongside abalone and shark's fin the sea cucumber which is found on the sea floor worldwide is highly valued for its nutritional and medicinal benefits fish maw refers to the dried swim bladders of large fish such as the sturgeon for the report a rapid assessment of online trade in sea cucumber and fish maw in malaysia and singapore researchers were able to identify about 20 species of sea cucumbers put up for sale online of these six species are listed as endangered under the international union for conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species those include the prickly sea cucumber and the sandfish also known as wen tu shen in chinese three of the 20 species are currently listed under appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites this means that the trade of the three species including the white teatfish or zhu po shen and the black teatfish must be controlled to ensure their survival and conservation in the wild of the 18 identified taxonomic groups of fish that the fish maw came from many species of sturgeons are critically endangered under the iucn red list sturgeons are also listed in cites under singapore's endangered species import and export act businesses need a permit to import and export any cites listed species in addition to recommending that the authorities monitor both the physical and online trade of these products the traffic report suggested countries introduce a traceability system to verify that only legal and sustainable products are sold in the market they should also carry out dna analysis of the products being sold online and in physical stores so that the species being traded can be better identified this will help the authorities to zero in on the proportion of species that are threatened endangered or prohibited from trade said the report mr david lim managing director of local sea cucumber wholesaler mr seacucumber said the majority of his dried products come from wild caught species instead of farms associate professor matthew tan chief executive of aquaculture engineering firm assentoft aqua asia noted that the maldives has been a prime location to farm sea cucumbers sustainably the archipelago has hatcheries and atolls ring shaped coral reefs encircling lagoons are used to rear sea cucumbers for example local mariculture company isles of eden has been rearing the popular sandfish sea cucumber or holothuria scabra in the maldives the company's website states that all its sea cucumbers can be traced to the exact lagoon where they were grown we raise our sea cucumbers in maldives naturally sustainably and with environmental impact in mind through science chinese restaurant chain tung lok group obtains its sea cucumber products from isles of eden said the group's ceo andrew tjioe local fish producer barramundi group's chief marketing officer james kwan noted that sea cucumbers grown via mariculture can help to clean the ocean floor by feeding on waste materials and recycling nutrients prof tan said it is more challenging to obtain fish maw sustainably since it would take aquaculture farmers too much time and resources to breed a fish just for its swim bladder today's main source of fish maw is from wild captured fish from large fish species such as totoabas and the nile perch in 1975 after the totoaba was declared endangered mexico outlawed its fishing but crime syndicates took control of totoaba swim bladder trafficking he noted however barramundi group's fish maw products are sourced from the swim bladders of the barramundi reared in its offshore open sea farms here mr kwan said this is part of our approach to ensure we fully utilise each fish from head to bones with the chinese new year approaching restaurants and suppliers here are seeing demand for sea cucumber and fish maw delicacies spike mr tjioe said both are part of several popular chinese new year delicacies such as pen cai a potpourri of seafood meat mushroom and vegetables in a casserole to find out if a seafood product on the market is sustainable consumers can look out for two certification standards the aquaculture stewardship council for farmed seafood and the msc fisheries standard used to assess if a fishery is well managed with wild populations and ecosystems not suffering said prof tan mr kwan added that a sustainable aquaculture farm should have minimal environmental impact on the surrounding sea with fish feed made from marine

        "content": "singapore singapore's labour market continues to recover with total employment expanding in the last three months of 2021 despite the outbreak of the omicron variant as the number of non resident workers employed grew for the first time in two years the unemployment situation also improved putting singapore on track for unemployment rates to decline to pre pandemic levels in the months ahead said the ministry of manpower mom on friday jan 28 the ministry added we expect the labour market to continue to improve in 2022 driven by an overall easing in domestic covid 19 restrictions and the resumption of international travel however recovery to a pre covid state continues to be uneven across sectors and uncertainty remains over the trajectory of the virus according to advance estimates released on friday total employment for 2021 had rebounded after the sharp contraction the year before in the fourth quarter alone total employment excluding migrant domestic workers grew substantially by 47 400 this was the result of stronger resident employment growth and a smaller non resident employment decline in 2021 said mom senior minister of state for manpower koh poh koon told the media it is certainly a relief to see that the labour market has maintained its recovery trajectory in the last quarter of 2021 alongside positive economic growth despite uncertainty over the global covid 19 crisis from the omicron variant in december the unemployment situation also continued to improve although annual rates remained above pre pandemic levels overall unemployment rate fell to 2 4 per cent in december from 2 5 per cent the month before the full year unemployment rate dropped to 2 6 per cent overall from 3 per cent before but this is still above pre covid levels the ministry noted retrenchments also stayed low in the fourth quarter and the number of people laid off in 2021 dropped significantly from 2020 from 26 110 in 2020 to 7 820 in 2021 mom said the majority of layoffs in 2021 were due to reorganisation or restructuring rather than a recession or business downturn over the year retrenchments had declined considerably across construction manufacturing and services it said the services sector showed the most improvement after a sizeable number of layoffs in 2020 due to the consumer facing and tourism related industries bearing the brunt of the pandemic then part of the increase in resident employment reflects seasonal hiring due to the year end peak period in the food and beverage services and retail sectors mom said employment grew in these sectors for the first time after consecutive quarters of declines resident employment also rose steadily in outward oriented sectors such as information and communications as well as financial services this is driven by the strong demand for digital solutions and games and software publishing activities meanwhile there was a considerable increase in non resident employment for the construction sector this was in part due to the resumption of entry approvals for fully vaccinated workers for the construction marine shipyard and process sector to enter the country from early november the ministry noted the non resident workforce in other sectors was relatively flat after consecutive quarters of decline the ministry said that adopting a risk managed approach in border control measures has allowed the non resident workforce to rebound to a small degree after two years of sharp decline but the growth in non resident employment at the end of the year could not make up for the declines in the first three quarters still with a smaller non resident decline and faster growth in resident employment mom expects a rebound of 40 800 in total employment for 2021 compared with the contraction of 166 600 in 2020 we expect the non resident workforce numbers to recover further in 2022 it added as for the resident workforce mom noted that overall resident employment grew much quicker than in 2020 and unemployment rates were steadily decreasing dr koh said the government and our tripartite partners will continue to provide support so that we can achieve not just labour market recovery as the economy and businesses restructure but help our workers to also find new employment opportunities mr patrick tay assistant secretary general of the national trades union

actual waiting times depend on the readiness of sites and specific bto projects and differ slightly from year to year hdb said a few projects launched in 2021 have longer waiting times due to challenging site conditions or very high blocks hdb said these include river peaks i ii along the rochor canal and queen s arc in queenstown which have an estimated waiting time of 5 5 or more years

he has also been crucial in exploring explainable ai methods for physicians to more accurately interpret the predictions of black box machine learning models given time his scientific contributions could pave the way for further groundbreaking syntheses in healthcare and technology to fulfil this dream he set his sights on going to medical school but that was no small commitment for singapore citizens the cost of a single year of tuition at duke nus is 47 050 subject to change over the four year duration of the course this adds up to almost 200 000 for tuition alone an impossible sum for some families as someone who had received a conditional offer from duke nus even before starting an accelerated course of study at sutd the sutd duke nus special track to be precise it was disappointing to think that financing his studies would be the primary obstacle between him and his dream as the only graduate entry medical school in singapore duke nus strong connections with the local healthcare community through their strategic partnership with singhealth and ready access to state of the art technology give them a myriad of opportunities to pursue research in a number of different areas furthermore as many students only intend to practise medicine in singapore duke nus is the perfect place for students to forge connections and lay the foundations for scientific collaborations with fellow physicians duke nus offers a unique research intensive curriculum that encourages students to become not only outstanding clinicians but also medical leaders and clinician scientists in the future continues prof thomas m coffman dean of duke nus through our world class md and md phd programmes where students receive their degrees from both duke university and the national university of singapore our students forge strong networks enabling them to become drivers of change to improve human health more than half of the students enrolled in duke nus are on financial aid like mr loh the majority of them are recipients of the duke nus bursary which covers up to 71 per cent of tuition fees something that could make or break a student s decision to attend the school at duke nus we strongly believe that any student who has met our rigorous admissions standards deserves the opportunity to train with the world s best faculty at our school regardless of their financial circumstances says mr goh yew lin chairman of duke nus governing board medicine is a demanding course particularly so at duke nus where students complete their md training in four intense years he continues by ensuring that our students do not have to worry about additional financial burdens the school then nurtures our students to become outstanding competent and empathetic doctors who give back to the singapore community by improving patients lives as such aside from the duke nus bursary the school offers a varied mix of both need based and merit based aid ensuring that students of all backgrounds receive the financial help that they need to succeed duke nus has a diverse range of financial aid programmes available to our students continues prof coffman more than 60 per cent of our current students receive financial aid in some form or other we continuously work hard to assure that sufficient funds are available to support all deserving students who come to our school another testament to duke nus generous financial aid policy is ms edina tan a beneficiary of the ngee ann kongsi distinguished scholars programme established in 2009 the programme offers up to 50 000 per annum to singaporean and singapore permanent resident students who have excellent academic performance but struggle with the demanding fees of medical studies ms tan is just one student to qualify for the highly selective scholarship duke nus financial aid has made me feel a lot more assured that i would be able to afford the otherwise hefty cost of postgraduate studies she says it allows me to concentrate wholly on my studies rather than worrying about the financial burden it entails like her fellow first year mr loh ms tan was impressed by the wide range of financial aid options available at duke nus which convinced her to apply to it in the first place as students who would have been unable to pursue their dreams without financial aid both mr loh and ms tan are highly outspoken about the importance of applying for it i can understand that the costly tuition fees can be a major concern says mr loh however it is also in my belief that no one should be disadvantaged from reaching their dreams or goals because of financial reasons i would suggest that any potential applicants speak to the school the admin is very friendly and i am sure they would be more than happy to work something out with you don t let the tuition fees deter you from applying concurs ms tan the financial aid options are diverse so you can be assured that you will be able to afford the course no matter your financial standing hence don t be afraid to take the leap of faith and pursue your passion support singapore s next generation of doctors so they can give back by

        "content": "singapore a baby's movements and babblings in his first year may be tell tale signs of developmental issues which often go unnoticed until later not meeting critical milestones such as rolling over or sitting may be signs of motor delays for example or not responding to sounds could be indicative of language disorders a new 12 1 million initiative aims to detect such needs as early as two months old so that children get more timely help when fully implemented about 1 800 children aged two months to four years old will benefit each year from the programme which will be launched in 16 pre schools over the next four years the centres run by the pap community foundation pcf are located in punggol and sengkang the pilot scheme known as mission i'mpossible mip2 will bring together different groups of professionals to support these children and their parents an interdisciplinary team comprising early intervention professionals curriculum specialists and therapists will work alongside social workers nutritionists and nurses in the same setting to meet the needs of children the programme by pcf kk women's and children's hospital kkh and philanthropic organisation lien foundation aims to show how children can receive education healthcare and social services within pre schools the interdisciplinary team of about 10 known as the school based child development unit will move around the pre schools and work with their teachers about 250 early childhood educators will also be trained to identify and support children with developmental needs the programme will cost 12 1 million of which 9 27 million is a gift from the foundation the rest of the amount is funded by pcf and kkh most of the funds will go towards manpower costs in a joint statement on wednesday jan 26 pcf kkh and lien foundation said that screening is currently done at the ages of five or six at pre schools conducting the existing development support learning support ds ls programme children identified to have developmental needs are then supported within the pre school or referred to other services such as the early intervention programme for infants and children programme eipic this leaves a short runway of one to two years before children enter primary school and it can take months to enrol in eipic said the statement lien foundation programme director ng tze yong said that lowering the age of screening to as young as two months old will help give children the earliest possible head start he added that the initiative also hopes to address some of the challenges parents of children with developmental needs face including the extra time and logistics needed to get a medical diagnosis and timely intervention currently parents need to first make an appointment for a preliminary assessment by a primary care doctor such as one at a polyclinic before another appointment at kkh to be evaluated can be made for them if necessary said mr ng the extra step of having to see a primary care doctor serves an important purpose of triaging sorting patients but it also unintentionally results in children falling through the cracks parents who may be facing difficult circumstances may struggle to make it to the appointment or settle on a wait and see approach instead this may result in the child's condition deteriorating unnecessarily it is a pity because the help is available but not accessed due to logistical challenges under mip2 parents will receive help from social workers in areas such as self care family activities and navigating government schemes and processes support will be provided for children from pilot pre schools transitioning to the next leg of their education journey dr honey ng pcf's deputy director for inclusive education said mip2's goal is to support children with developmental needs in the natural classroom environment this is key for pcf as we believe that every child deserves a good start with quality pre school education despite their diverse learning abilities an inclusive environment also encourages children to be more empathetic and loving and embracing of others with different abilities she said associate professor chan yoke hwee chairman of the kkh's division of medicine and programme director of mip2 said studies have demonstrated that attendance in a high quality pre school programme and therefore attention to a child's physical and cognitive development in early childhood are associated with better metabolic and mental health as well as academic and socio economic outcomes later in life a study will be done after four years to evaluate the lessons from this pilot mip2 builds on its predecessor mip1 which was launched in 2009 by the same partners pcf kkh and lien foundation the scheme then began as a three year pilot in 25 pre schools upon completion it was adapted by the government and renamed the ds ls programme which is today available to more than 40 per cent of children aged

        "content": "singapore selling land on limited leases is necessary for a small country like singapore as it allows for the land to be recycled for future generations said panellists at the institute of policy studies' singapore perspectives conference discussing the question of who owns a city on monday jan 24 they noted how the government's policies on land help to achieve redistribution of not just the land but wealth as well if everything is owned by a few people instead it would be more difficult for the government to find land to build affordable housing and provide essential infrastructure said professor cheong koon hean chair of the singapore university of technology and design lee kuan yew centre for innovative cities prof cheong who is also chairman for the ministry of national development's mnd centre for liveable cities added in the case of singapore we cannot compare to other countries which have lots of land the professor who was deputy secretary at mnd from 2001 to 2016 and chief executive of the housing board from 2010 to 2020 said rejuvenation is necessary after a period of time and to this end certain areas will have to be redeveloped say in tandem with economic changes leasehold land allows for this virtuous recycling of land for future generations as well as economic dynamism she added she noted that besides the 99 year lease on hdb flats land and property for commercial and industrial uses is typically sold on a 30 year lease the leasehold concept is actually a very important concept particularly in the case of singapore but i would say even in large cities because a city cannot just sprawl and sprawl forever said prof cheong so if you have a lot of activity in a certain boundary it needs to rejuvenate you need to recycle the brownfield sites she said referring to sites that have been previously developed mr manohar khiatani senior executive director of capitaland investment noted that in a land scarce country like singapore policymakers typically have to make difficult trade offs he cited how in the early days of singapore's industrialisation when the country was seeking to attract multi national companies to set up shop here they were allowed to buy land on 60 year leases as this gave them more predictability but as singapore's economy matured change happened at a much quicker pace some of the land occupied by such companies were no longer being put to good use and such leases were reduced to 30 years he cautioned that a fine balance needs to be struck to ensure scarce land is used well even as singapore seeks to attract foreign businesses during the session moderated by ips senior research fellow christopher gee both panellists noted that the government plays the dual role of facilitating economic growth and redistribution prof cheong said zoning rules and the appropriation policies such as land acquisition are forms of redistribution of wealth besides its regulatory function zoning also ensures that land is set aside to achieve both economic and social goals ensuring that the price of land needed for parks hospitals and schools is not pushed up by market forces the land acquisition act in singapore has also allowed the government to procure land mostly in the 1960s and 1970s to build social facilities and infrastructure such as public housing noting that this is also done in other countries prof cheong said in a way acquisition of land is a form of redistribution of wealth mr manohar said the government's role also ensures the price of land is not left fully to market forces which may cause distortions for instance if the price of industrial land were left to market forces a lot of important manufacturing activities may be priced out of the market he said noting that manufacturing has a tremendous multiplier effect on other aspects of the economy ultimately it's not about maximising land price it is about maximising the economic returns that that land can give us he added his view was shared by prof cheong who said that when there is rapid urbanisation in a small space such as with singapore there is a lot of stress on land and land prices can increase tremendously if market forces and hence land price determine how land is used it can exacerbate inequality and result in a systemic transformation of land ownership to corporates and large developers over the decades which can affect the texture of the city she added join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "singapore wearing a mask does not just protect you from covid 19 it protects others from you if you have an asymptomatic infection in this vein all safe distancing measures are really about that sense of solidarity with others says deputy prime minister heng swee keat he was explaining in an interview for a new book why singapore's third fiscal package in 2020 out of an unprecedented five totalling 100 billion in pandemic support measures was named the solidarity budget the book in this together singapore's covid 19 story arrives as the city state reaches the two year mark in its fight against covid 19 at first glance singaporeans have largely accepted covid 19 restrictions for the greater good exemplifying the solidarity that mr heng spoke about but as the pandemic nears what some believe to be its season finale with the hope that the latest highly transmissible yet milder omicron strain could herald the start of living with the virus as people do with the flu some questions are worth asking what lessons in solidarity can singapore glean from its covid 19 experience given the pandemic induced divides and distrust seen in societies around the world how vulnerable or hardy is our state of social cohesion as we emerge on the other side of a generational crisis how do we keep singaporeans in this together public health scientists sociologists and governance experts say there is cause for optimism pointing to how singaporeans have pulled together and responded to the pandemic through ground up movements and aid for the needy but they also note that covid 19 has produced polarised attitudes on policies such as around vaccines and aggravated socio economic fault lines along class ethnicity and nationality the saying 'we are all in the same storm but different boats' is worth reflecting upon as we commemorate the second anniversary of covid 19 in singapore said associate professor jeremy lim from the national university of singapore's nus saw swee hock school of public health clearly the pandemic has been trying for everyone but the intensity of struggle and the support provided very different but he added we are moving in the right direction in the sense that at least the harsh spotlight of inequalities has been shone and the public and policymakers are aware of 'invisible populations' and 'digital divides' what matters is how we translate these lessons into improving the lives of all residents as well as give peace of mind that the country as a government and as a people will look out for the least among us in february 2020 in his first of several speeches on covid 19 prime minister lee hsien loong described the outbreak as a real test of singapore's social cohesion and psychological resilience globally the pandemic has been a catalyst and what it does to levels of cohesion hinges on a government's ability to fulfil its social contract with the people are policy decisions logical evidence informed feasible transparent clearly explained this has generally been the case in singapore's covid 19 response said associate professor natasha howard also from the saw swee hock school of public health social cohesion is also a function of trust in public and private sector leadership and in information sources and polls such as the edelman trust barometer show that trust is diminishing globally adjunct professor lutfey siddiqi from nus' risk management institute pointed out singapore however has bucked the trend by recording strong levels of trust in the ethics and competence of both government and business institutions singapore has also outperformed many others in its economic response to covid 19 with gross domestic product now exceeding pre pandemic levels added prof siddiqi from a social cohesion point of view the macroeconomic backdrop in singapore should also help create resilience not resentment some experts say the pandemic has amplified the importance of collectivism and solidarity on top of the self reliance that is a core part of singapore's national ethos there is stronger awareness that we are a nation with interdependent individuals and families rather than a nebulous crowd of self sufficient individuals said nus sociologist tan ern ser associate professor andy ho who specialises in psychology and medicine at nanyang technological university sees this in the numerous community efforts to help those most affected by the pandemic he and the other experts cited initiatives to aid migrant workers low income households seniors students hawkers and more by the time pm lee delivered his national day message in august last year his assessment was that singapore's social cohesion had held though this could not be taken for granted covid 19 has strained fault lines in our society and brought up difficult issues that we need to deal with he acknowledged an immediate pressure point is the lingering difficulty in achieving consensus on singapore's overall covid 19 strategy said associate professor alex cook from the saw swee hock school with extremely high vaccination and booster rates the disease is much less serious now he noted some people may see the remaining risk as being sufficiently high that we should keep the measures we currently have in place for the long term while others such as myself see the risk as low enough that we should retire most or all of them and treat covid 19 the same way we treat the flu recent polls by the institute of policy studies ips showed divergent views on the issue with just over half of respondents feeling positive about living with the virus as endemic and agreeing with having vaccination differentiated measures close to half backed unmasking when outdoors or in uncrowded areas with a similar proportion expressing confidence in eating out covid 19 measures have also hit small heartland businesses and food and beverage outlets harder than most with many crumbling under a plethora of changing rules and the pressure of having to reinvent and transform said prof lim he suggested this was driven by the government's underlying low trust in residents even if the converse is untrue and people here have a high level of trust in the state this signals in my mind that the government's relationship with the governed is still somewhat infantile and immature he said we still have some way to go to a partnership governed by mutual respect and mutual trust he also pointed to policies creating dichotomies within groups themselves giving the example of the business travel pass scheme which allows senior executives based in singapore and with regional or international roles to fly regularly they can move in and out of the country with more ease than work pass holders whose return is contingent on them obtaining entry approvals a situation that has resulted in some families being separated for long periods the place of foreigners in singapore's society along with racial issues and the plight of lower wage workers make up the fault lines referred to by pm lee in his national day message in his subsequent national day rally speech he acknowledged that covid 19 had intensified anti foreigner sentiment and brought race relations under stress leading to a glut of incidents over the last two years he committed to tackling these issues through landmark measures like an upcoming law on racial harmony but singapore ultimately also needs to work on new methods of creating understanding between people with different cultural compasses said dr kalpana vignehsa a research fellow in ips' governance and economy department we should be exploring ways to connect with the messy nuance of one another's lived experiences she said because focusing on neat identity labels and passive learning about identity groups is unlikely to give us the momentum we want towards improved solidarity and cohesion she added that singapore could further strengthen its social cohesion which she believes to be already hardy and resilient by continuing to openly negotiate fault lines from the ground up speaking at an ips conference on jan 13 health minister ong ye kung seemed to broach a loftier goal than cohesion as a nation's people undergo common trials and tribulations over time this togetherness will forge common ideals that transcend primordial tribal instincts and overcome forces that deepen social fault lines he said then something mysterious emerges like the soul of a nation dr vignehsa proposed that another route to forging common ideals was to ensure that all who choose to share in singaporeans' space whether in the long or short term feel like they belong perhaps our 'soul' is tied up with feeling the warmth of singapore's embrace regardless of the groups we identify with she said prof ho described the epitome of the soul of a nation as its people sharing the same vision towards a greater good with a joint conviction towards civic mindedness and compassionate citizenry such collective consciousness has immense potential to overcome differences he said no matter how difficult they are in this together singapore s covid 19 story retails for 28

singapore party non constituency mp leong mun wai with a warning that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it not content with just marshalling spanish philosopher george santayana's famous axiom against mr leong's latest statements in parliament the article also drew parallels with the deja vu that movie hero neo experienced in sci fi classic the matrix right before all hell broke loose the article came two days after mr leong was given the opportunity to clarify claims that he made in the house but instead used it to restate his allegations mr leong said a day earlier that he had received feedback from residents that some teachers have applied vaccination differentiated measures in schools he subsequently said his claim was based on a screenshot from a telegram chat group sent to him by a facebook friend the petir article asked readers if they were experiencing a curious case of deja vu given that the raeesah khan affair had taken place just two

        "content": "singapore the united states and china should negotiate guard rails and create a direct and open communication channel so its leaders can contact each other quickly over taiwan to avert conflict said emeritus senior minister goh chok tong on wednesday jan 19 speaking virtually at the third hong kong forum on us china relations he noted that china has reiterated on countless occasions that it will take military action if taiwan crosses beijing's red lines and makes a move towards independence but a big unknown is where the tipping point lies mr goh said to avoid miscalculation leading to military conflict the us and china should create the 21st century equivalent of the red telephone he added mr goh was referring to the secure system that us and soviet union leaders used to communicate after the two powers came close to a nuclear war in 1962 over the installation of soviet nuclear missiles in cuba my biggest concern is whether taiwan becomes a casus belli i do not think the mainland wants to invade taiwan and reunify it through force however if it sees no prospect for peaceful reunification it may believe it has no choice he said referring to how taiwan could become the issue that provokes war between the us and china the more international space taiwan gains which beijing sees as the result of tacit encouragement from the us the more the mainland will ratchet up pressure on taiwan mr goh said there was mutual strategic distrust between the us and china stemming from the difference in values ideologies worldviews political systems and perspectives on global governance the us having assessed that china is its main strategic competitor and a threat to american national security and values has bolstered its military capabilities in the asia pacific and has also drawn attention to alleged human rights abuses in xinjiang and hong kong he noted from washington's perspective china is not following the established rules of the global order despite being a chief beneficiary instead china is seeking to rewrite these rules in its favour mr goh added meanwhile beijing sees this at best as washington's containment strategy to prevent china's rise and at worst as a long term strategy to weaken china and break it up he said hence china is building up multiple defensive and offensive capabilities that it reasons are needed to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity he added happy to give a virtual keynote speech at the 3rd hong kong forum on us china relations at the invitation of my good mr goh said that if the two superpowers cannot overcome their mutual distrust the world will be condemned to deal with the geopolitical repercussions of the contentious us china relationship for eternity he called on concerned countries leaders institutions media business think tanks and people who want to avert a catastrophic clash between the us and china to urge the two superpowers to play a positive sum game and not a zero sum game or worse a negative sum game describing this as the voice of moderation he said it advocates strategic rationality peace growth and prosperity within an interdependent open inclusive rules based multilateral order mr goh said asean as a prime example of how countries with very different geographies histories languages and political systems can pursue a common vision of a peaceful and prosperous south east asia can be a substantive voice of moderation we have consistently encouraged both the us and china to remain productively engaged in the region across different sectors both countries are dialogue partners of asean and we hope to continue engaging both china and the us at asean meetings at the highest level he said the forum organised by the china united states exchange foundation and the china centre for international economic exchanges is also a meaningful voice of moderation at their virtual summit in november us president joe biden had called for common sense guard rails while chinese president xi jinping had compared the two countries to two giant ships that must forge ahead together without colliding citing this mr goh said actions on the ground should reflect the two leaders' words the us and china must see that it is in their own interests to maintain a stable and peaceful international environment both countries need to implement 'trust but verify' agreements as they try to resolve outstanding bilateral issues while attaining their geopolitical ambitions beyond merely avoiding conflict the relationship between both countries should be underpinned by healthy competition and driven by cooperation where possible added mr goh he noted that both president xi and president biden had spoken of fair competition adding that this means there is common ground to work together pointing to the many pressing global issues that require us china cooperation such as free trade climate change and global pandemic preparedness mr goh said the us and china will have to address what exactly healthy competition will look like in accordance with international law and the existing international rules based order expressing hope that both major powers would have made good headway in managing their mutual strategic distrust by the next forum he added doing so will require wisdom and statecraft of the highest order i believe both presidents biden and xi possess these qualities i pray that they will be able to build up strategic trust between their countries and peoples join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news

        "content": "singapore parliament on wednesday jan 19 explained its rules for conduct in the chamber in a post shared by speaker tan chuan jin who said he expected mps to be able to substantiate what they say in the house and would not hesitate to be firm when he has to be in a short facebook note of his own he said that if every mp speaks debates and questions as and when he or she pleases it would be inappropriate and parliament would be chaotic in such instances if he disallows mps from speaking it is because they have been out of order or there are no provisions for them to do so he added when that happens my role is to ensure discipline and to maintain dignity and order in the house he said an mp's conduct in the house is regulated by the speaker and guided by certain rules that set out when mps can speak and how they should do so among the rules are that mps are not supposed to speak unless they have been called upon to do so by the speaker and the latter can direct an mp to stop a speech after determining the member is persisting in irrelevance or tedious repetition an mp also has to direct his speech to the chair whenever he is speaking and cannot address another member directly such as by referring to your speech or you said this in addition an mp should not make unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations in parliament these rules allow for a dignified orderly and effective conduct of proceedings even as members have the opportunities to give speeches clarifications and explanations on certain matters said the post filed under parliament's good to know folder the folder has explanations on other parliamentary proceedings and matters such as select committees and ministerial statements parliament's latest post comes after this month's sitting during which non constituency mp leong mun wai claimed on jan 10 that he received feedback from residents that some teachers had practised vaccination differentiated measures in schools but could not substantiate what he said when given the opportunity to make a clarification on jan 11 the progress singapore party ncmp went on to restate his allegations instead after several reminders from mr tan that he should not make another speech when giving a personal explanation mr leong told the house that he got the information off a screenshot from a telegram chat group that was sent to him by a facebook friend leader of the house indranee rajah responding to the fact that mr leong made allegations based on a screenshot issued a stern reminder to mps to exercise their privilege responsibly ms indranee and mr tan had also reiterated this point on parliamentary privilege after former workers' party mp raeesah khan admitted to lying in parliament in a speech she made on aug 3 last year 2021 in its post on wednesday parliament explained that a personal explanation is an opportunity for mps to make a short statement to explain justify or apologise for his or her conduct with regard to a particular question or occasion or to correct an alleged misrepresentation such an explanation can be made after question time and can be done only after an mp gets advance permission from the speaker the mp must submit the terms of the explanation to the speaker beforehand said parliament it added that based on standing order 25 which sets out the rules for personal explanations no controversial matter may be brought up during such an explanation and no debate may arise upon the explanation parliament has put together a simple piece to help the public understand some of the rules governing the business in during the jan 11 session of parliament leader of the opposition pritam singh pointed out to mr tan when a personal explanation is made you would actually receive the whole statement in full so the assumption was when you mentioned personal explanation you would have had sight of what mr leong was going to say mr tan said to mr singh that mr leong had written to him asking to make a clarification so he did not cite the specific issue of personal explanation but that is the category i am putting it under on wednesday parliament said other types of explanations in parliament include ministerial statements made by ministers and other office holders to explain important issues of public interest and clarifications by mps on their previous speeches mr tan said that in most instances mps have been responsible and matured in their behaviour and conduct and there has been little need for me to crack the proverbial whip he added that he would not hesitate to be firm when needed and that it would be remiss of him to do otherwise i have stated before that i would take a more expansive approach to allow for freer debates in parliament and have done so for all sides of the house however this doesn't mean that members can take liberties to do whatever they so wish he said parliament has 103 mps consisting of 92 elected mps two ncmps and nine nominated mps

        "content": "singapore in a world where working remotely has become more commonplace making it easier for people to relocate cities like singapore which offer not just a good business environment but also quality of life will have a competitive edge in attracting global talent but while the mobility of the global workforce allows singapore to compete for talent in a way that was not possible before this could also worsen inequality said panellists at the singapore perspectives conference on monday jan 17 that is why the pursuit of economic achievement must happen in tandem with improvements in other social dimensions they added harvard university economist edward glaeser ministry of trade and industry permanent secretary gabriel lim and landfall strategy group founding director david skilling were speaking at the city as economic space session on the challenges and opportunities that singapore faces in its ongoing urban economic development while cities emptied out in the early months of the covid 19 pandemic and social restrictions have altered the way people work and live these changes will not add up to cities and offices becoming obsolete as predicted by some said professor glaeser in recorded remarks in a world of information intensity we get smart by being around other smart people we get creative by being around other smart people he added in fact technology such as zoom will not kill off cities but has given people more choices in terms of where they want to live increasing competition for global talent and with human capital key to a city's success the question is whether singapore can reinvent itself to become the best place for people who can work anywhere to live work and play said mr lim he acknowledged the sensitivity that might arise from this talent policy noting that people around the world have become anxious from competition to assuage these concerns the government is adjusting its manpower policies to strike a balance between openness and assurance for workers as well as strengthening institutional support to help people upgrade such as through the sgunited jobs and skills programme he said mr lim added that the government is also paying special attention to social support and community care for those who are less skilled and more vulnerable i want to assure members of the public that we are not just these very mercenary people we understand that all of us are involved in nation building and the only way to build a nation is to make sure that it is inclusive that people see in singapore a home for all and it's united it's cohesive he said in response to questions about people being left behind in singapore's pursuit of being a global economic hub even if singapore does not develop as a global city it does not mean that there will be fewer people left behind he added citing how the covid 19 pandemic and previous recessions have shown that it is always the vulnerable who are more badly hit when the economy does not do well i think what's important for us is to continue to maintain that focus on growth but at the same time making a special effort on redistribution making sure that it is more inclusive and giving everyone a greater share of the prosperity said mr lim this sentiment was shared by dr skilling who noted that when growth is more broadly shared governments can pursue open markets more aggressively and on a more sustained basis but he noted that while singapore may enjoy the best of both worlds in terms of being a country and a city it also faces the challenges of both worlds the complication for singapore is that singapore is both simultaneously a country and a city he added he said other global cities like london and new york for instance can focus on per capita income and do not need to worry so much about income distribution or cost of living since people there can quite easily leave for other lower cost areas of those countries an option that is not open to singaporeans so while it makes sense to benchmark itself against such big global cities singapore simply cannot replicate their policies and must chart its own path dr skilling added he cited the government's push to grow local firms into global players saying this will create more opportunities for singaporean workers and companies besides maintaining its competitiveness vis a vis global talent singapore will also have to expand its global connectivity in a post covid 19 world to thrive said psa group chief executive officer tan chong meng and maritime and port authority of singapore chief executive quah ley hoon at another session the two panellists who spoke on the theme city as connected space said singapore's ports for instance must always strive to be slightly different from other ports so as to maintain its stickiness mr tan suggested that with today's digital platforms and connectivity singapore should work to set up the right highway and common data environment that allows the ports here to orchestrate the different parts of the chain together with shipping lines to better benefit from the network effect join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking

doing well i would like to assure many well wishers that i have been giving myself more time to rest during this period i i excused myself early from parliament sitting yesterday to go home for lunch

        "content": "singapore scientists from nanyang technological university ntu have developed a therapy that uses a gel and infrared light to burn fat a possible safer treatment for people working to control their weight drugs that tackle obesity are meant to accompany exercise and a healthy diet in helping people who are severely obese including those who have metabolic disorders but many in the market come with side effects laboratory trials by the ntu team from the school of chemical and biomedical engineering show that mice on a high fat diet that underwent its therapy weighed 5 5 per cent lighter after two weeks and lost between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of body fat in the therapy a transparent gel called a hydrogel developed by the scientists is injected into a layer of fat under the mice's skin an infrared light is then shone on the injection site for five minutes a few times a day to trigger the hydrogel's fat burning ability infrared light refers to wavelengths of light that are not visible to the human eye but can be felt as heat when exposed to the infrared light nanoparticles in the hydrogel convert light into heat to activate a protein in the body that kick starts the fat burning process in this process white fat which stores excess calories and leads to weight gain is converted into calorie burning tissue fat cells become energy burning instead of energy storing said bioengineering professor chen peng who led the study after two weeks of the treatment which includes eight days of rest the mice lost 40 per cent of the fat under their skin and 54 per cent of the fat surrounding their internal organs the rodents also had lower cholesterol levels and reduced resistance to insulin suggesting that the procedure has the potential to reduce the risk of metabolic disorders said ntu in a statement on tuesday jan 25 touching on the therapy's safety the research team said the hydrogel nanoparticles made of copper sulphide have negligible toxic effects on vital organs and tissues and although the process uses heat converted from the infrared light to burn fat under the skin the team found no thermal injury to the mice's skin said prof chen the hydrogel also contains substances that are approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for instance the gel contains an fda approved drug for people with overactive bladders which the ntu team repurposed for its therapy the team envisions the therapy being used as a home treatment one day similar to an insulin shot patients with obesity can inject the hydrogel into their belly fat for instance in multiple places once a week they can then light a hand held laser at the injection sites for five minutes a few times a day and repeat this over several days to activate the fat burning process the scientists are hopeful that their therapy could be an alternative to costly fat reduction procedures that only target fat under the skin and obesity drugs approved by the fda that often come with side effects according to the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases in the united states the common side effects associated with weight loss drugs include diarrhoea constipation nausea and headaches all fda approved medications for obesity indirectly act on the brain to suppress appetite or on the digestive system to reduce fat absorption most of them have been withdrawn from the market due to their serious side effects said prof chen in contrast our therapeutic approach focuses on remodelling white fat tissue which is the root of the evil in february 2020 the fda requested that a weight loss drug called belviq be voluntarily removed from the us market because a safety clinical trial showed an increased occurrence and risk of cancer the ntu team is now looking to collaborate with partners to conduct clinical trials with one or two patients as a start to further test its therapy the test on mice found no abnormalities in their internal organs and tissues the animals did not show any abnormal behaviour as well said prof chen but he noted that careful studies must be done to observe the possible side effects of the therapy on humans we don't have a 100 per cent sure answer yet but my guess is that serious side effects would not be a concern for our method particularly when you compare it with the current drugs that are used he added the study's findings were published in scientific journal acs nano in december last year although the cost of the therapy is still uncertain prof chen said it is likely to be much less costly compared with weight loss or fat reduction surgery senior research fellow than aung who is also part of the research team said each hydrogel jab could cost between 10 and 20 as several jabs a week are likely required for the treatment the cost may be comparable to existing obesity and weight loss drugs which cost several hundred dollars a month commenting on the ntu team s therapy alexandra hospital s head of general surgery asim shabbir said the method is promising as it triggers fat loss by converting white fat into calorie burning tissue and also breaks down fat deep within the body dr asim noted that available anti obesity treatments are unable to burn fat in regions outside the areas of treatment this technology adds to the growing number of tools available to treat obesity however it will need rigorous human testing before one would know if the results are the same in humans as in mice added dr asim who specialises in obesity treatment and metabolic surgery in 2019 singapore researchers developed an appetite curbing pill that inflates into a balloon in the stomach to induce a sense of fullness so that less food is eaten the capsule is still being developed

        "content": "singapore you have mail but is it safe to open the letter local experts say the risk of catching the coronavirus from a package or envelope is extremely low and people need not be concerned this comes after the chinese authorities said on jan 17 that the nation's first case of the omicron variant in beijing could have arrived via a package from canada china said it would step up disinfection of overseas mail and state broadcaster cctv called on people to minimise purchasing of overseas goods and receiving mail from abroad they were urged to wear masks and gloves when opening the mail but on saturday bloomberg quoted a chinese health official as saying there is insufficient evidence thus far that non frozen imported goods had brought covid 19 into the country professor laurent renia who specialises in infectious diseases at the nanyang technological university's ntu lee kong chian school of medicine told the straits times that the main way covid 19 is transmitted is through exposure to droplets fomite transmission where someone catches the virus from contaminated surfaces or objects known as fomites might happen but the risk is considered low he added associate professor natasha howard from the national university of singapore's nus saw swee hock school of public health noted that when the pandemic started fomite transmission had been considered a concern nobody had much information yet about this new virus and the health authorities had to respond quickly so experts made some general assumptions based on transmission patterns of other known viruses with pandemic potential such as influenza h5n1 and so on which included significant fomite transmission she said adding that early lab tests had shown the coronavirus could survive on certain surfaces for extended periods of time however subsequent research over the past years indicates that touching surfaces is a much less important mode of transmission than breathing the virus in she said professor dale fisher senior consultant at the national university hospital's division of infectious diseases said catching covid 19 from the mail is almost impossible but could take place under a freak set of circumstances prof fisher who is also a professor of medicine at nus' yong loo lin school of medicine explained that first the sender or someone else handling the mail would need to be infected and contaminate the item the virus then would need to survive on the mail for the duration of the journey and not be rubbed off the virus could certainly live on a fomite for a week and i imagine most mail would travel in less time he said adding that the virus can survive for days in high temperature and weeks when cool but he added what would be most challenging though is for the virus to remain on the item in sufficient quantity to cause an infection this quantity required is likely less with omicron but i still find it would be quite remarkable for the perfect chain of events to line up to cause an infection this is because even after the mail arrives the recipient would still need to transfer the residual virus with his hands from the item to his mouth nose or eyes every time there is a transfer the quantity of virus reduces said prof fisher he added that people should not be concerned about this or catching the virus from touching surfaces at all as the risk of infection is much greater when going out to eat vaccination is the mainstay of protection for all means of transmission and those vaccinated will almost certainly have a mild illness this is what covid 19 resilience is all about if people are concerned then simply wash your hands after disposing of the mail packaging this is a concern in china because of their ongoing zero covid 19 strategy which most would argue is not sustainable said prof fisher associate professor alex cook vice dean of research at the nus saw swee hock school of public health agreed he said the risk of acquiring infection from your mail is so much smaller than the risk of getting it from your friends or family that we can pretty much ignore that risk the only time we'd be at all concerned about mail as a vector for infection would be in countries still pursuing an aggressive zero covid 19 strategy and with no or little community transmission like china prof renia said that when it comes to touching surfaces especially with chinese new year around the corner simple solutions are still key such as washing hands with soap or hydroalcoholic solutions prof howard added that while it is always helpful to keep surfaces and hands clean cleaning surfaces is unlikely to help very much in avoiding omicron which is transmitted primarily through contaminated droplets and small airborne particles thus vaccination safe distancing and mask wearing appear more helpful to reduce transmission join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to

the amount cheated has also grown from 2 3 million in total in 2011 to 12 million in 2015 and 33 1 million in 2020 dr lim boon leng a psychiatrist at gleneagles medical centre said love scams are seductive because people innately crave companionship he said some people find it harder to find love interests especially during the pandemic and scammers prey on this void that potential victims are looking to fill dr lim added that some of his patients fell for the ruse after scammers spent a lot of time gaining their trust they think that scammers would not bother to get to know them over an extended period so when they are shown a lot of care and concern they believe it is a real relationship he said but it is e commerce scams that consistently top the list with the most number of cases reported each year there were 3 354 cases reported in 2020 a 55 per cent increase from 2018 in the first half of last year 2 4 million was lost to e commerce scams with electronic goods and gaming

consultancy bain company there are concerns the amount cheated would climb mr amos tan assistant director of singapore polytechnic's school of business said the pandemic has driven many people to shop online and e commerce platforms are trying to retain customers with frequent promotions the shift in our lifestyles has provided ample opportunities for scammers e commerce scams are not only expected to rise but also more variants will emerge he said despite efforts to educate the public about scams dr lim said not everyone will synthesise the information and apply it to their lives even if people read about others getting scammed in the news they might not identify with it because they don't think they will be conned he said rebecca not her real name a 42 year old accountant did not think she would fall victim to a scam but in 2020 she lost her life savings of 250 000 to scammers behind a china officials ruse they had claimed her bank account was involved in a case of money laundering in china posing as officers from dbs bank the swindlers called her to say that she had an outstanding credit card bill from buying a necklace in beijing when she denied making the purchase the call was diverted to a police officer purportedly working in beijing who claimed that she had been charged with money laundering offences one of the scammers even donned a police uniform in a video call to her they furnished court documents with my name to show that i had been charged with money laundering it was frightening and very real said rebecca who is a singaporean desperate to clear her name she followed the scammers' instructions to create a uob account transferred all her savings there and handed her banking credentials over to aid investigations rebecca realised her account had been emptied only when police officers in singapore called her on jan 7 last year to inform her that she had fallen victim to a china officials impersonation scam she said she did not receive an sms one time password otp on her mobile phone before the six figure sum was withdrawn from her account one possible explanation is that the scammers used her login details and changed the phone number associated with her account so that the otp was sent to their mobile instead all my retirement savings were gone in flash i was so afraid of being in trouble with the chinese authorities that i followed their instructions blindly she said scammers pose as the victim s business partner supplier or employee and ask for funds to be transferred to a new bank account the e mail usually sport the

dollars each month in contrast almost all of the 110 hawker centres managed by the national environment agency nea or nea appointed operators allow groups of up to five people to eat together hawkers do not have to foot the cost of implementing such checks as it is borne by the government logistical challenges such as having to consider the layout of the coffee shop when cordoning off certain areas are another obstacle since nov 23 coffee shops with the necessary control measures can allow groups of up to five fully vaccinated people to dine in to do so they must control access by cordoning off areas and have dedicated entry points at these entry points they must check the vaccination status of all patrons and differentiate those who are fully vaccinated and are dining in they also have to put up posters informing diners that only fully vaccinated people can dine in groups of up to five mr hong poh hin vice chairman of the foochow coffee restaurant and bar merchants association said many of the larger coffee shops have indoor and outdoor seating areas usually separated by a corridor or a walkway which is also used by residents in the neighbourhood as coffee shops are not allowed to seal off these common areas they must cordon off their indoor and outdoor areas separately and station someone at each of these entrances hiring one person would cost them about 2 000 a month mr hong said some of the coffee shop operators would want to pass on some of the cost to their stallholders but not all stallholders would agree because the zi char stalls would benefit the most from larger groups but these larger groups such as families tend to patronise the coffee shops only on weekends many operators feel that the uptick in business does not justify the additional cost mr hong said his association represents about 400 coffee shops for coffee shops with very popular stalls barricading the indoor seating area would also be difficult as queues for such stalls can sometimes extend beyond the area mr kenneth lee vice chairman of kheng keow coffee merchants restaurant and bar owners association said covid 19 is not something that will last for a month or two we don't know when the pandemic is going to end so in the long run all these extra costs will add to our operating expenses sooner or later the operators and stallholders will not be able to absorb them and we will have to pass them down to consumers coffee shops also run the risk of getting fined or suspended if safe management measures are breached enforcement action may be taken against diners or operators or both with the additional cost being too much to bear most operators have decided to wait and see if they can hold out said mr lee but coffee shops that stick to allowing dining for only two people also have to grapple with slower business with diners preferring to go to eateries where they can sit in larger groups ms hasria hashim who sells malay food at kim san leng coffee shop in tampines said she has seen a 40 per cent drop in customers compared with when larger groups were allowed competition is tough as there are other coffee shops and the nearby tampines round market and food centre allows groups of five to sit together she said we felt that it is unfair because not all coffee shops have the manpower many people are vaccinated so i don't see an issue with our coffee shop allowing five people to dine in together some stallholders also have to remind patrons to abide by the rules ms huang ya dong a drink stall assistant at a coffee shop in toa payoh said she has come across unhappy and difficult customers who do not want to follow the rules there are some difficult customers who would tell us 'do you expect me to sit on the floor ' when we ask them to seat no more than two per table we usually have to explain the regulations to them again mention the fines they would incur and take photos of them if needed the singapore food agency said that private operators coffee shops and canteen operators can decide if they want to implement the required measures to allow larger groups to dine in but noted that some may not choose to do so due to difficulties it added that it will continue to assist coffee shops and canteens when required such as by giving advice to operators who are unsure of how to implement the measures join st's telegram

summit held in dubai she highlighted green innovations and efforts in the uae such as its vast solar parks and being the first in the middle east and north africa region to declare a net zero commitment by 2050 dubai houses the region's first solar driven hydrogen electrolysis facility to produce green hydrogen where the gas is produced using renewable energy and has zero emissions singapore is keen to collaborate with the uae on improving the technical feasibility and the establishment of supply chains for low carbon hydrogen said madam halimah such advanced low carbon technologies are an area of interest for singapore which has pumped 55 million into 12 research projects in the areas of hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage a local study looking at the feasibility of using hydrogen as a fuel stated last year 2021 that singapore would need to explore various supply pathways for price competitive low carbon hydrogen it was reported in june last year that three singapore agencies were studying whether hydrogen could be imported via ships or pipes we cannot afford to work in isolation when our planet's future is at stake cooperation partnerships and leadership are critical said madam halimah sustainability plans and road maps including our singapore green plan will need to be refined as technologies evolve mistakes are made and

in the middle east added madam halimah minister for sustainability and the environment grace fu said in parliament last week that there is significant uncertainty associated with technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage their commercial success hinges on factors such as technological maturity and transboundary cooperation which are not entirely within our control she said during a debate on singapore's green transition there have been sustainability related collaborations between the uae and singapore last year a few abu dhabi organisations collaborated with

        "content": "singapore a group of students in singapore is calling on universities here to wean off their links to the fossil fuel sector amid growing worldwide scrutiny of the ties between institutes of higher learning and that industry members of the students for a fossil free future in a 68 page report published on its website on monday morning jan 17 are calling on seven universities here including the national university of singapore nus nanyang technological university ntu and singapore management university smu to take steps such as divesting from the fossil fuel industry and discontinuing research funding associated with the sector universities should also not promote jobs in oil gas or coal sectors at networking or other professional development events but instead highlight career opportunities in cleaner industries such as renewable energy sectors that do not involve the extraction refinement or other use of fossil fuels the report highlighted these programmes impress upon students the career viability of the fossil fuel industry however the fossil fuel industry is a sunset industry which may limit medium to long term career viability said the report the main contributors to the report are students from nus ntu smu and the singapore university of technology and design sutd said the group's spokesman ntu undergraduate shawn ang 23 but the group also consulted widely and a total of 64 individuals including undergraduates university alumni and other professionals were involved he added the burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of modern climate change the use of coal oil and gas to fuel cities and economies has already caused the planet to warm by 1 1 deg c above pre industrial levels climate scientists have said that global heating should be limited to 1 5 deg c in order to avoid harsher climate impacts such as rising sea levels and more extreme weather events students around the world have become increasingly vocal about the need to limit warming to this threshold saying it is their future at stake if the climate crisis is not dealt with today mr ang said the report aims to shed light on issues beyond finance such as divestments in fossil fuels this is important given not only the financial significance of the fossil fuel industry but also its social influence he added for instance the report highlighted the exxonmobil nus research fellowship which is sponsored by the oil giant and the glencore scholarship offered at smu by the commodities firm with stakes in oil and gas oil firm bp has also held a recruitment talk and a personal branding workshop for ntu students the report noted given the urgency of the energy transition in the light of the climate crisis we see our report as a starting point for conversations and imagination around the role that our higher institutions can and should play said mr ang we hope that this will encourage discussion and commitment from our university leaders towards playing a more active role in our nation's just transition the report delves into the links that seven universities in singapore which also include yale nus the singapore institute of technology the singapore institute of management and sutd have with the fossil fuel sector in four key areas other than finance the report also looked at academia such as scholarships funded by fossil fuel firms professional development such as networking events attended by oil giants and the association that fossil fuel companies have with campus spaces singapore's government has banned cigarette companies from sponsoring and publicising corporate social responsibility activities clearly signalling that an industry whose core business is harmful should not be positively rebranded said the students in the report on this front the students cited exxonmobil's sponsorship of concerts and conservation programmes at nus as well as a mobile fabrication laboratory at sutd mr ang said putting together the report involved trawling the internet combing partnerships and events pages annual reports directories of university management and staffing lists wherever they were available simultaneously our members from various universities also combed through internal school portals to detail associations and linkages he said after a first draft was completed the report was circulated to 50 other individuals ranging from undergraduates to academics and other professionals for peer review the feedback collected then led to two subsequent rounds of editing with sources being checked and updated where necessary at each round to ensure factual accuracy said mr ang the undergraduate team behind the report was inspired by a similar report published by the cambridge zero carbon society in 2018 called decarbonising cambridge a pathway to divestment and positive reinvestment he added as students we understand the linkages between fossil fuel companies and our universities as a key force that left alone will shape our collective futures and determine the world we live in said mr ang for example mr ang said the group's networks have shown that many undergraduates secure jobs upon graduation through career and recruitment events at schools these events contain considerable presence from fossil fuel companies and directly influence where the talent of our society's engineers scientists and professionals flows to fossil fuels or more sustainable industries he added globally a number of universities have announced plans to start divesting from fossil fuels including oxford university the university of british columbia the university of california harvard university and national taiwan university an smu spokesman said the university was developing its approach to environmental social and governance issues including responsible investment she added we have initiated a process that will take us forward in important ways in the short medium and long term representatives from nus and ntu both pointed to sustainability commitments by their respective institutions saying the universities are committed to doing their part to tackle the global crisis the ntu spokesman said the university s sustainability framework had involved substantial consultation feedback and input from internal and external stakeholders and domain experts he added that the university s investments which does not specifically target the fossil fuel industry enable it to maintain a steady stream of funds to support its long term growth while guarding against disruptions such as having to significantly increase tuition fees during economic downturns environmental social and governance considerations are carefully integrated into the investment management process to balance the university s sustainability objectives with its fiscal health and financial outcomes for the portfolio and endowment fund over the long term he said the nus spokesman said that nus had last year 2021 rolled out a sustainable investment policy incorporating environmental sustainability we will continue to encourage our fund managers to divest from polluting assets he said we value the ideas and feedback of our student groups in championing climate action and a sustainable future we are open to suggestions on how nus can continue to support environmental sustainability efforts

        "content": "singapore a couple euthanised their long term companion to put an end to the dog's months long struggle with illness in its old age but their sorrow deepened when they realised just days after their dog's death on jan 7 that he had allegedly been handed the wrong medication by the hospital the medication was meant to treat heart failure for another dog named romeo the couple's dog named ah bee had taken these pills for two days said ah bee's owner aesthetics doctor donna chow she said the dog was a 12 year old miniature schnauzer who suffered from an eye disease and kidney failure the whole thing was very regretful dr chow 41 told the straits times on jan 18 we were grieved beyond words about the medical negligence that has occurred and at the same time guilty that we were part of it dr chow and her husband shaun koh 44 lodged a complaint with the animal and veterinary service avs and mount pleasant veterinary group mpvg which treated ah bee at its hospital in jalan gelenggang both organisations said in separate statements that investigations into the incident are under way and that they were in contact with the dog's owners avs group director jessica kwok said in a statement avs will investigate allegations of professional misconduct negligence and contravention of the code of ethics for veterinarians enforcement action will be taken where appropriate when contacted mpvg field director bessy chua said we are taking steps to ensure our existing rigorous protocols for prescribing and dispensing medications are upheld to prevent errors she added what we can confirm is that we have no reason to believe pimobendan had an adverse impact on his the dog's health or outcome pimobendan is a medication used to treat dogs with heart failure according to vet publication vca animal hospitals it stated that common side effects include decreased appetite or diarrhoea and that these can last longer in pets with kidney disease dr chow said ah bee's health worsened after surgery last may to treat his poor vision in his old age he later developed kidney failure and internal bleeding and in december the couple were told ah bee had only months left to live following a discussion with the vet mr koh made the call to euthanise ah bee to end his suffering as the dog became lethargic refused to eat kept vomiting and had bloody diarrhoea but as dr chow cleared out ah bee's medications the next morning she noticed pimobendan tablets labelled for another dog a photo of the delivery instructions showed that the dog romeo was to be fed half a tablet twice daily a total of 5mg dr chow said her family did not check the label at first as there were many tablets issued to ah bee having fed ah bee three doses of the pimobendan pills over two days she feared they may have worsened his health in his final days due to an overdose she said the hospital later acknowledged to her that the wrong medication had been issued and told her that the vet who operated on ah bee was not a specialist the hospital declined to comment on the specifics of ah bee's case saying it had to adhere to the code of ethics for vets and out of respect for the family's privacy it later said there were no board certified eye specialists locally at the time of ah bee's surgery the hospital added that there was no evidence that the surgeon had claimed to be an eye specialist but that she was experienced and had successfully carried out this surgery many times over the past seven years the ordeal prompted ah bee's owners to start an online petition to urge for a review of the governance of pet healthcare here the petition has garnered more than 10 400 signatures as at thursday jan 27 all vets and clinics in singapore are licensed and regulated by avs under the animals and birds act said ms kwok who added that it inspects clinics to ensure that they comply with licensing conditions she said avs has been studying the need for a professional entity to improve professional standards for the sector and had engaged those in the industry since early 2021 when contacted by the straits times those in the industry refrained from commenting on ah bee's case on the urging of avs as investigations are ongoing but speaking generally animal welfare advocate and former executive director of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals jaipal singh said the effects of pimobendan depends on the animal's health dosage given and possible interaction with other drugs he urged the public not to make generalisations about vets which can be a disservice for many professions who work hard for animal health and welfare dr haoting chow honorary editor of the singapore veterinary association said it was normal for surgical procedures to be done by general practitioners who have played a key role in animal healthcare long before specialists worked here action for dogs president ricky yeo also urged owners to read the labels on all

employers will also need to take responsibility for their maids if they break the law or sustain injuries while living separately it told the sunday times it was responding after some straits times forum letter writers suggested relooking employment rules to allow maids to live apart from their employers under the employment of foreign manpower work passes regulations migrant domestic workers mdws must stay in the same residence as their employers any other residential address must be approved in writing by the controller of work passes mom noted that there have been only a small number of cases where mdws were found to be living separately from their employers there were 245 600 mdws in singapore as at june 2021 according to mom earlier this month st reported that there were more than 50 requests from employers and maids on social media in the past year for live out arrangements live out maids who enjoy the privacy such arrangements bring can be paid as much as 1 500 a month which covers their rental transport and food expenses this is double what some maids here get every month they know it is illegal to live outside their employer's home without approval from the authorities but say it is a secret agreement in its reply mom said it is aware that some households may require domestic services but are unable to accommodate a mdw in their homes due to space constraints or a preference for privacy for such households the ministry urged them to consider the household services scheme hss which allows employers to engage help for part time services such as home cleaning grocery shopping and car washing instead of hiring a mdw these workers from approved firms can be deployed to multiple houses on a part time basis they live in accommodation provided by their companies hss companies are currently allowed to hire female workers from countries such as india myanmar sri lanka thailand and cambodia this is in addition to the existing approved countries in the service sectors such as china malaysia and north asian sources including taiwan and south korea the scheme introduced as a pilot programme in 2017 was made permanent in september 2021 following an increased demand for example professional cleaning service company amahs on wheels charges 380 for four once a week cleaning sessions in four and five room housing board flats a pet sitting session costs 30 per hour on a weekday or 50 per hour on a weekend at a minimum of three hours per session mom added that it will continue to monitor demand from households and assess if the scope of services under the hss can be further expanded meanwhile humanitarian organisation for migration economics home which advocates on behalf of migrant workers has called for a review of the stay in rule for mdws it highlighted the demand for live out arrangements adding that this can be beneficial for both employers and mdws allowing mdws to live out will give employers and mdws a chance to choose a living and working environment that best suits them employers and mdws can agree on a salary that will cover the mdw's accommodation transport and food needs as well as the working hours that the mdws are to abide by said ms jaya anil kumar research and advocacy manager at home such arrangements will give employers and mdws space from each other and may make for a healthier working relationship between them live out options will allow mdws to have fixed working hours and get sufficient rest she explained adding that overwork remains one of the top complaints the group has come across living in the employer's house may also make mdws more prone to isolation thus making them more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse added ms anil kumar who said that home often encounters mdws who are made to live in cramped spaces such as the storeroom and kitchen space constraints are also a concern for yio chu kang mp yip hon weng a member of the government parliamentary committee for manpower mr yip who is married with five children said his household does not have a room for a maid instead he engages a firm that hires locals and migrant workers to offer part time services under the hss on whether a live out arrangement for maids would work he noted that it gives employers privacy and offers an opportunity to instil independence in the young ones when the helper is not around but he said there are issues that need to be addressed who will look for her accommodation is the higher salary meant for her to pay for her own accommodation will she then have to fend for herself and look for her own home he added employment agencies st spoke to said they are not in favour of live out arrangements while acknowledging that such an arrangement may help lead to better relationships between the employer and the domestic worker workforce manpower's director michael khan said the mdws may end up abusing the system they may moonlight and get involved in other illegal activities he added mr william lau director of employment agency maid avenue said the majority of employers who currently hire live in helpers mainly do so because they require taking care of the elderly children or pets what happens if for example the maid needs to leave the home at 10pm but the infant needs taking care of if a live out arrangement is made legal most maids would prefer it said mr lau adding that this would then leave a hole in the market to address the needs of most singaporeans if they were to stay out they may also come to their employer's house every day distracted he said join st's telegram

by the singapore accountancy commission sac and the economic development board edb the maps roll out is also supported by workforce singapore wsg and skillsfuture singapore ssg ms indranee said we're now entering a post pandemic world one that is driven by digitalisation and technology and is grappling urgently with climate change these drivers are set to reshape the accounting profession while at the same time creating opportunities for those who are nimble enough adaptive enough and willing enough to seize them these new trends include the accelerated rate of technology adoption changing aspirations of job seekers who want more job satisfaction and environmental social and governance esg concerns she added to capture these opportunities firms must invest in new technology upskill their accountants and improve work culture for finance and accounting professionals what this means is that your job roles will become more diversified than before you will need to harness the power of technology and to pick up new skills in emerging areas like sustainability she said the new maps identify key technologies and their impact on individual job roles in finance and accounting functions and accounting practices they also lay out the pathways for employers to transform jobs and for workers to get the needed skills as new job roles emerge and existing roles evolve sac edb wsg and ssg said during the launch that the job transformation maps are vital for the sector as the demand for new roles and services continues to grow with a projected demand of 6 000 to 7 000 new accounting jobs by 2025 this number will add to the current workforce of more than 100 000 employees which includes 80 000 workers in in house finance and accounting functions and about 20 000 in accounting practices accounting practices will see accelerated growth in demand for manpower due to increasing digital maturity of both clients and accounting practices the rise in clients' demand for advisory services and increasing emphasis on non financial metrics in valuing businesses said the four organisations they added that increased demand is expected in tax risk advisory mergers and acquisitions financial forensics and business valuation the in house finance and accounting segment will also be critical in supporting firms as they expand overseas the jobs transformation maps studied 58 job roles and found that 45 of them will require minimal to moderate job redesign over the next two to five years and are not vulnerable to displacement but the remaining 13 roles will see a high degree of change in job tasks and require reskilling of staff these roles such as accounts assistants involve repetitive tasks that can be automated meanwhile studies by ernst and young and deloitte found that new roles will also emerge such as specialist ethical hackers citizen data scientists and esg specialists the job transformation maps also indicate the need for upskilling in technology and soft skills sac edb wsg and ssg said technology skills that are increasingly in demand include the application of artificial intelligence cloud computing data analysis and interpretation and robotics and automation soft skills required include adaptability creative thinking and customer orientation amongst others to support skills upgrading a job redesign initiative was also launched on wednesday to help firms review work processes to streamline them and improve productivity eligible companies can receive the productivity solutions grant for job redesign as well this initiative was piloted last april with nine small and medium sized enterprises helping more than 40 workers to enhance their jobs of whom 17 per cent are mature workers manpower minister tan see leng

        "content": "singapore six police buildings in and around the old police academy will be proposed for conservation and integrated with future developments in the mount pleasant area the decision to retain the buildings was made after a first of its kind heritage study was undertaken for the old police academy site said national development minister desmond lee on tuesday nov 23 four of the retained buildings lie within a future 33ha housing board estate on the site while the other two are just beyond the boundary of the new estate this was the first time we'd done an in depth heritage study of this scale which is apt considering the scale of the new housing estate said mr lee during a media briefing the former academy which spans about 25ha is the site of singapore's first permanent police training facility established in 1929 it was operational until 2005 when its functions were relocated to the home team academy in choa chu kang it symbolises the transformation of our police training and education marking the shift from a wooden and attap temporary site to an institution which has enabled our police to grow and to evolve from keeping order in a british settlement to preserving the peace and prosperity of an independent nation said mr lee who added that generations of national servicemen and police cadets have fond memories of their experiences on the academy's grounds the large scale independent heritage study undertaken by the national university of singapore's department of architecture compared the significance of the various buildings and spaces in the old academy and assessed how the new housing estate could affect the overall heritage significance of the site it took place between august 2018 and september 2019 about 48 buildings and two open spaces were studied in detail said an urban redevelopment authority ura spokesman mr lee said the development of the new housing estate gave the authorities an opportunity to pilot the large scale study and added that lessons learnt from this study will guide future ones as well as an ongoing effort to develop a heritage impact assessment framework more details on this framework will be shared when ready the study found that nine buildings and areas within the old academy were considered the most significant in the history of singapore's police force they are blocks 1 2 27 28 and 153 an old drill shed a swimming pool the parade square and the recreation field this is due to their strong organisational and historical associations architectural and aesthetic values as well as deep communal associations with the police in singapore and malaysia said the hdb ura and singapore land authority in a joint statement within the future housing estate's boundary blocks 1 2 27 and 28 will be retained and proposed for conservation they will be adapted for new uses the four blocks were built between 1926 and 1930 as part of the original police academy and their geographical distribution reflects how the buildings had been laid out according to the terrain administrative and training functions were located on flat lower ground while accommodation and medical facilities were placed on higher and hillier ground in particular blocks 1 and 2 were the main administrative buildings situated at the original main entrance of the academy in whitley road they were physical visual and symbolic landmarks for trainees providing the backdrop for parade ground events and graduation photo shoots as for blocks 27 and 28 the pair of colonial style bungalows were used as senior officers' accommodation each bungalow has a unique butterfly shaped semi detached layout with full length verandahs and were designed to suit the tropical weather while retaining english style design roots situated on high ground they overlook the academy and are visible from the pan island expressway a part of the parade square will be retained as an open space within the new housing estate meanwhile two buildings outside the housing estate's boundary will also be proposed for conservation construction of block 13 began in 1928 and it was used as a clinic and hospital ward it also served as the primary entry point to the medical centre built in the style of plantation houses the building was designed with surrounding verandahs and large timber shutters for natural ventilation also outside the boundary is block 153 which is also known as the senior police officers' mess this building built in 1931 is deemed the foundation of the force's esprit de corps having hosted many formal gatherings official functions and events such as festive celebrations weddings and networking and socialisation events for serving and retired officers for buildings and spaces that cannot be retained in their entirety mr lee said hdb will explore various strategies to retain and showcase their heritage significance in the new housing estate's design the heritage study's full report has been published on hdb's website and is open for public feedback until dec 21 asked why the heritage study was not called prior to the commencement of works for the mount pleasant mrt station in 2015 a ura spokesman said an internal assessment had taken place to assess the area affected by mrt construction occupied by six buildings and ancillary structures these were assessed to be of low heritage significance and demolished in 2015 subsequently given the scale of the old police academy site and its deep history we decided to carry out a more detailed heritage study to supplement our internal assessment said the spokesman who added that a study on a similar scale for the former turf club in bukit timah has also been called mr lee said that engagement on future plans for the housing estate will include a new work group comprising members of the police fraternity the heritage community and government agencies the work group will be chaired by minister of state for home affairs and national development muhammad faishal ibrahim and will collaborate to develop plans to retain and showcase the unique heritage identity of the area within the design of the new hdb estate join st's

told the straits times on tuesday nov 23 the estate is still in the conceptual stage but its design will take inspiration from the heritage and nature in the area which was developed in the 1920s said national development minister desmond lee four existing buildings that were part of the old police academy along with part of the parade square will be retained and adapted into community spaces to serve future residents the estate will have a low rise neighbourhood centre which is typically the heart of an estate where amenities such as retail shops are located it will be designed to be open and green and will feature community spaces said the hdb urban redevelopment authority ura and singapore land authority sla in a joint statement on tuesday the 33ha estate around one third the size of bidadari is bounded by thomson road and the pan island expressway pie it is located close to the mature town of toa payoh residents will be served by the upcoming mount pleasant mrt station on the thomson east coast line which will open in tandem with the completion of the bto projects when asked if hdb flats in the mount pleasant estate will fall under the new prime location public housing plh model which imposes stricter ownership conditions hdb said it will assess the site attributes and announce more details when ready there are currently no plans for private housing in the site the hdb told st the site for the housing estate which is on a brownfield site has been earmarked for residential use in the ura's master plan since 1998 and will require minimal clearance of existing vegetation brownfield sites are land that had previous developments on them there are a number of existing pre war black and white bungalows which are not conserved in nearby mount pleasant road a good class bungalow gcb cluster is located further up north in the caldecott area the old police academy was opened in 1929 as the police depot and was used as police training and education grounds for the next eight decades before its functions were relocated to the home team academy in choa chu kang because of the estate's proximity to bukit brown the central catchment nature reserve and the densely forested surrounding areas an environment impact study was conducted said mr lee besides nature groups the authorities also consulted heritage groups and the police community on the proposed development plans in order to preserve as much of the heritage and nature in the area as possible plans for the housing estate were adjusted according to the findings and feedback received he said for instance the original road network would have cut through the existing kopi sua cemetery but was instead revised to allow access via onraet road which is off the pie it exemplifies our evolving approach towards land planning how we're involving the community and stakeholders more to balance different needs sensitively and further strengthening how we plan for the long term added mr lee part of the singapore polo club around 3 000 sq m or 3 3 per cent of its total land area will be acquired by the government to become part of the estate a stable a storage shed and a sand pit will be affected but the clubhouse field and main horse stables will not be said sla a joint agency workgroup will be set up to further look into how the heritage of the old police academy can be preserved and incorporated into the residential parcels and the design of common spaces such as parks before any works are carried out these could include proposals for new road names related to the police heritage the workgroup will be led by minister of state for home affairs and national development muhammad faishal ibrahim the announcement of the new estate comes as demand for public housing remains high among singaporeans with application rates for bto flats jumping by 70 per cent in 2020 ms christine sun senior vice president of research and analytics at orangetee tie said future hdb flats in the mount pleasant area is unlikely to fall under the plh model as the site does not fit the criteria plh sites are near the city centre or downtown core and properties in the area should command a price premium this location is not that near to the city centre she said however huttons asia senior director of research lee sze teck reckons the site has potential to be considered as a prime area under the plh model as it sits within district 11 covering the novena newton and thomson areas regardless of whether the site falls under the plh model both concur that bto projects in mount pleasant will see strong demand at their launch ms sun said the place sits in the centre of singapore which makes it very convenient for residents to travel to many parts of the island but the drawbacks could

host to thousands daily at its 4 5ha campus in the heart of singapore's civic district a large number of members of the public also criss cross the campus daily they may stop for a meal at one of the cafes in the basement concourse view an art installation at the de suantio gallery use the running track on the campus green or attend events such as the singapore night festival in an interview with the straits times smu president lily kong said the university community knows how privileged it is to be given the prime location in the heart of the city for a university that started off as a business university having the banking and business community on its doorstep was priceless over the years we have leveraged our location and the various communities there including the business legal and cultural institutions and groups but having the prime location comes with the responsibility of giving back to the city and the smu community has done this in many ways she said these include allowing the use of campus facilities for public events and students taking on community service projects to help disadvantaged groups such as some homeless people who took shelter in the university's basement concourse integrating the entrance pillars of the old national library in stamford road into the smu campus was also a way of giving back professor kong said in constructing the smu connexion the university chose to retain the brick pillars and the cast iron fence of the former national library building they are a part of singapore's history and the collective memory of generations of singaporeans for whom the national library building was a cherished part of their lives apart from the key role of preparing students for jobs in a rapidly changing world universities also have an important civic role she said our responsibility goes beyond preparing graduates for jobs we can nurture engaged citizens and cultivate meaningful involvement in the community be it through community based participatory research volunteer work or initiatives that support social development she said before discussing the many other ways in which smu tries to be a university for the people not just for its students a yes pre covid 19 there was a constant stream of people using our concourse and campus green which has a running track that is open to the public smu also lends its venue for many public events including the art festivals and the singapore night festival we also have seminars talks and workshops which are well attended so in that sense we are a university in the city but we also bring the city into the university in many ways a our faculty and students have leveraged our urban location for the mutual benefit of university and city as i said earlier in the initial years it was a boost for our business school faculty and students who could tap the firms nearby for case studies work attachments and student projects the business community in turn has the opportunity to tap the university's vast database of knowledge and intellect in the form of its teaching faculty student body research resources and its offerings of executive education and customised courses smu's yong pung how school of law too has linked up with law firms in the city to provide work attachments for our students we bring in top lawyers and judges for talks and to mentor and interact with our students at the same time the law faculty gives back our law students with the help of volunteer lawyers run a pro bono legal clinic on campus it helps about 300 people a year who need legal help our other four schools also engage and collaborate with various public and private sectors in the vicinity you see it in many cities around the world the strategic interplay between universities firms entrepreneurs research labs and the diverse communities in the city and we draw strength from one another in virtuous circles of innovation a our research is geared very much to solving the challenges faced by singaporeans and bettering their lives take for example the centre for research on successful ageing rosa set up in july 2020 which was built on the foundations of its predecessor the centre for research on the economics of ageing rosa does research on issues related to ageing through the centre's work we are able to examine government's policies impacting older folk and how tweaking these policies may lead to improved outcomes for older adults in singapore and ensure their well being into later life in the last two years we have released important research findings on how the covid 19 pandemic has impacted older singaporeans through our research we have found that older singaporeans are concerned about access to affordable healthcare even as singapore transitions to a phase where covid 19 is endemic while the pandemic has disrupted the provision of healthcare for older adults who suffer from chronic ailments the respondents' satisfaction with health remained constant as the shift to working from home enabled some older adults to adopt healthier lifestyles and exercise routines this brings to attention the point on how we can improve older adult well being even after the pandemic a it remains very important to us higher education is widely viewed as a pathway to social mobility studies have shown that most universities successfully level the playing field across students with different socio economic backgrounds because they provide greater value add for children from low income families smu has the access programme that guarantees eligible students a financial aid package which pays for 100 per cent of their tuition fees after taking into account all scholarships bursaries and other grants a student receives unlike most other scholarship programmes it does not involve an often stressful interview process and there is no cap on the number of recipients in perpetuity smu access is also bond free a certainly universities should prepare students to be economic citizens i am happy to report that smu continues to do well in preparing its students for jobs the university's class of 2020 notched a high job rate despite the disruptions brought on by covid 19 close to 94 per cent found jobs within six months of completing their final examinations both the mean and median gross monthly salaries were at an all time high preparing our students for the job market remains an important role for us and all universities but to prepare young people for the changing world of work universities have had to go beyond just providing a strong grounding in the disciplines that students choose to study it is also about developing other skills and attributes including global competency adaptability and resilience these skills are so important that increasingly universities around the world including smu have drawn up plans to ensure the development of these skills is explicit and intentional and given priority smu has various programmes in place including overseas experiences work study opportunities and smu x student projects to nurture these key competencies professor lily kong is the fifth president of

spots for computer degree studies a the ministry of education moe has not said exactly how many university places it has planned to offer in the six local universities this year but rest assured that it will offer enough places to ensure at least a 40 per cent cohort participation rate which means that four in 10 of the age group going into university will be given places in the university also as the straits times reported last week moe said it will consider opening up more places in the six local universities for students whose plans to study overseas have been hit by the pandemic it will consider doing this even if the cohort participation rate for singaporeans again goes beyond 40 per cent education minister chan chun sing said in an interview with st that the cohort participation rate had gone past 40 per cent in the last two years to accommodate students who could not go overseas in 2020 the six universities here took in 17 500 students in total and last year they increased this further to 17 800 places the cohort participation rate reached 42 per cent in both years a in recent years the universities have increased the number of courses in this field which are officially referred to as information and digital technology idt degrees as a result the number of places has also gone up significantly in reply to your question moe said that with falling student cohort sizes idt places cannot increase indefinitely without eventually affecting the manpower pipeline for other important economic sectors it said it will need to take a calibrated approach when considering any further increase to idt places to distribute talent across the whole of singapore's economy a your son has chosen a popular field of study that offers good job prospects computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our lives from the cars we drive to how we work to how we entertain ourselves a computing degree can open the door to an array of high paying

choice should be driven by considerations of target job roles subject areas of interest and any prerequisites of each degree programmes he said students interested in degrees offered by scis should

        "content": "singapore the great task for a city like singapore in a post covid 19 world is to keep reinventing itself to stay relevant and competitive said minister for health ong ye kung who spoke on the topic of cities at a forum on thursday jan 13 within the confines of singapore's 730 sq km is a city and also a country and people have no option to choose between a freewheeling urban economic centre and a quiet life in the suburbs he added running an effective state and getting the politics right are thus key to ensuring that the small island of singapore can accommodate all the different aspirations of its five million people he said rather than endless bickering and stalemates the political process must be constructive and help bridge divides the objective of politics must be to help the country find a way forward even if the decisions involve very difficult trade offs he added this is especially important to singapore for what we lack in resources and strategic mass we can make up with nimbleness and unity of purpose and action we may be small but we can be fast and we do things together mr ong was giving the keynote speech on cities countries and resilience at the singapore perspectives 2022 forum organised by the institute of policy studies at the lee kuan yew school of public policy recounting the stories of great cities past and present he said singapore cannot be modelled after any one city as we are a city we are a state we are also a nation of one people all rolled into one like new york city singapore is a modern day metropolis as well as a global economic node that needs to be connected to the world to thrive he said that is why singapore has to be like a smartphone that runs a good operating system and hosts all the apps essential to life so that it is not easy though not impossible to switch out of singapore he added this has required constant reinvention with singapore leveraging its geographical location to build a trading hub then growing strategic industries from manufacturing to biomedical sciences and now becoming a centre for green finance he said through the pandemic singapore has also positioned itself as a hub for vaccine manufacturing and distribution and should seize the opportunity to rethink how it can do things better and smarter he added describing the pandemic as a large reset button he said singapore should build on the changes that covid 19 has forced upon work retail education and healthcare to transform itself for instance even after the health crisis a combination of working from home and from the office will allow people to better juggle their professional and private lives and also allow cities to alleviate the peak hour rush that has dictated the planning and development of transport infrastructure for so long he suggested the minister who co chairs the multi ministry task force on covid 19 along with finance minister lawrence wong and trade and industry minister gan kim yong said coping with the pandemic has tested singapore's mettle as a city he added that personal responsibility and civic consciousness have been key in helping the country ride each infection wave we have to trust that people will do the right thing in testing themselves and isolating themselves if they test positive he said while these have been done out of necessity i believe it has helped us grow as a people i hope it is the start of a societal attitude that is more forgiving of imperfections embracing setbacks and failures appreciating resilience ruggedness enterprise and even being unconventional the first forum of singapore perspectives 2022 city featured a keynote speech and q a session with minister for health as a small city state singapore is also like the imperial city of chang an now known as xi'an in china said mr ong where the government must defend the city and maintain law and order to run an effective state to this end singapore's founding generation has build up a good government with an executive branch that is effective and can get things done a non politicised civil service and a judicial system that upholds the rule of law without fear or favour he said there are also democratic institutions such as the parliament formed through free and fair elections he added affairs of the state cannot run away from politics which can both put the fate of the country in the hands of the people and keep powers in check when done right but polarise the population and destabilise societies when allowed to go wrong said mr ong getting this right is especially crucial for singapore which needs unity of purpose to thrive as a small open country he noted that is why a strong state is necessary to grapple with inequality protectionism and climate change the starkest political issues faced by societies today he added policies need to be consistent in the long term to make an impact instead of being reoriented with frequent changes of governments at the same time there must be discourse to hear and consider diverse views and proper checks and balances he said the success of singapore state depends on our ability to achieve both aims he added like the ancient city of jericho one of the oldest human settlements that was born when hunter gatherers gathered to cultivate crops in an area with the right conditions singapore is also the result of people coming together to forge a common fate and destiny said mr ong as members of a close knit tribe there was a recognition that by working together and making sacrifices for one another we have a better shot at a brighter future he added but unlike the inhabitants of jericho who are a natural tribe of similar origins singaporeans are far more diverse this makes singapore far more complex than any ancient city said mr ong noting that a sense of nationhood is not a given and needs to be forged through a long term and subconscious process of nation building in singapore we are working on what it means to be singaporean day by day he said citing examples of students singing the national anthem daily at school assemblies different communities living side by side in housing board estates and young men serving national service together these are all acts of nation building many of these come through deliberate policies and programmes implemented by the state referring to singapore's bicentennial year in 2019 mr ong said people here had voted self determination as what best describes the country's dna during a public voting exercise cities don't need it many states don't even think about it but a young nation like us dreams of and cherishes self determination he added he said there was a growing consciousness about what it means to be singapore as a key node of the globalised world that connects the east and the west and creates vast opportunities for its people a country with institutions of state that will ensure justice and fairness to all uphold meritocracy and bridge divides and as a nation that gives every community a place under the sun where people give and take rather than push their own agenda at the expense of others with all of these we will determine our own future and be a city state and nation that continues to thrive for many years to come he added join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to

        "content": "singapore helping singapore businesses and workers grasp opportunities in the green economy was a key issue discussed in parliament on wednesday jan 12 with 19 mps sharing their thoughts on how this can be achieved in a five hour long session they discussed ways to create more jobs in the sustainability sector and further the nation's ambitions to become a major green financial hub under the second motion on climate change moved by the government parliamentary committee gpc for sustainability and the environment these should be achieved together with the private sector civil society and community to advance singapore's inclusive transition to a low carbon society the gpc said the straits times highlights the suggestions raised by mps a carbon tax is a means of assigning costs to the release of planet warming emissions that are driving climate change such as carbon dioxide by putting a price on the release of these gases firms will be incentivised to reduce their emissions by becoming more energy efficient investing in lower carbon technology or by incorporating more renewable energy in their fuel mix during the debate mps including mr louis ng nee soon grc and ms foo mee har west coast grc noted that singapore's current carbon tax rate was too low mr ng said singapore's carbon tax has the highest potential to reshape incentives and motivate action and called on the government to increase the rate and to expand it to more firms singapore's current carbon tax rate which will be in place until 2023 is 5 per tonne of emissions the revised rate for 2024 will be announced during next month's budget which will also indicate what to expect up to 2030 singapore's carbon tax now applies to all facilities producing 25 000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year covering 30 to 40 large emitters that contribute 80 per cent of singapore's greenhouse gas emissions mr ng said this threshold should be lowered so all firms emitting more than 2 000 tonnes of emissions also pay a carbon tax this would after all be in the spirit of a whole of nation fight against climate change emitters small and large have a role to play he said other mps such as mr saktiandi supaat bishan toa payoh grc acknowledged the need to raise the carbon tax but asked for it to be done in a carefully calibrated manner to reduce impacts on businesses mps pointed to the pros and pitfalls of allowing the use of carbon credits by emitters in singapore to offset their emissions a carbon credit refers to one tonne of carbon dioxide co2 that is removed from the atmosphere a forestry restoration project or prevented from being produced a renewable energy plant these credits can be bought by an emitter elsewhere to offset its own emissions if this is allowed it would mean that a company here would have the option to pay another entity to reduce emissions in another jurisdiction where it may be cheaper to do so nominated mp koh lian pin who heads the national university of singapore's centre for nature based climate solutions said the republic is located in a region with a rich bounty of natural habitats such as forests and peatlands that can help reduce the amount of planet warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere nature based carbon projects such as mangrove conservation and restoration can also deliver many other benefits for local communities and biodiversity said professor koh moreover nature based carbon projects are low hanging fruits that allow mankind to turn off one tap of our carbon emissions by ending deforestation and start to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through reforestation he said the burning of fossil fuels and land use changes from deforestation and the removal of natural habitats are key drivers to modern climate change but prof koh associate professor jamus lim sengkang grc and mr gan thiam poh ang mo kio grc urged caution about the use of carbon offsets pointing out that some carbon offset projects may not deliver real benefits to the environment prof koh said users of carbon credits must also have in place concrete policies plans and actions to transition to a lower carbon economy to ensure that they are not relying solely on offsetting to reduce their net carbon emissions prof lim added while it is impossible to perfectly police greenwashing attempts the government should not be complicit in lending a stamp of approval to firms that are simply pronouncing adherence to such standards for the purposes of going through the motions or worse marketing reasons mps also pointed out key areas in the green economy that singapore could benefit from ms hany soh marsiling yew tee grc said green roles that will soon be in higher demand include engineers in the built environment sustainability consultants and green finance and investment managers mr don wee chua chu kang grc noted that accountants and auditors must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to cover emerging tasks such as sustainability reporting managing climate related risks and advising their companies on embedding sustainability in the firm's strategy and decisions accountants must be equipped to prepare sustainability reporting as more stakeholders and investors adopt environmental social and financial performance metrics likewise auditors need to get themselves ready to verify such information he added to help accountants flourish in the green space the institute of singapore chartered accountants isca the national accountancy body with more than 33 000 members will be rolling out courses and certification programmes that will include sustainability reporting ms soh added that there is also a lot of scope for students to become green entrepreneurs and come up with new innovations to further sustainability solutions in the area of food security in minister for trade and industry gan kim yong's response to the motion on wednesday he noted that in the long term opportunities lie in low carbon technologies such as hydrogen sustainable aviation and maritime fuels smart electricity grids and sustainable food we are investing research and development resources into these areas which we will need for our own living and livelihoods in the process we hope to build new economic engines out of them added mr gan ensuring that singaporeans have the right skills to meet the demands of a green economy was also discussed with mps throwing up suggestions such as rolling out sustainability linked university courses or skillsfuture courses that will help mid career professionals gain the relevant skills mr gan said as singapore pursues our sustainability goals many green jobs will be created that will require new green skills a traditional car mechanic will need to learn how to repair an electric vehicle a power engineer will need to learn about hydrogen solar and other renewable energies an investment manager will need to learn about sustainability standards and green financing ms poh li san sembawang grc suggested that major updates and changes are made to courses and modules in educational institutions along with green projects that should be integrated into all disciplines meanwhile ms rachel ong west coast grc said there is a need to close the current employability gap between undergraduates in green courses and employment in relevant sectors for example employment rates for students in environment engineering were one of the lowest compared with other engineering graduates in national university of singapore nus and nanyang technological university ntu according to the 2020 graduate employment survey therefore it would be necessary to work with the private sector and institutes of higher learning to close the employment gap in addition curriculum for up and coming green sectors can be further enhanced in institutes of higher learning in consultation with industry players to better understand the skill sets that are needed ms poh also urged enterprise singapore and skillsfuture singapore to work closely with the labour unions to equip senior workers with relevant skill sets for green jobs so as to minimise job displacement as companies transit into the green economy mr dennis tan hougang pointed out that workers in carbon intensive industries including fossil fuel related sectors should not be left behind as the economy goes green we need to ensure that corporate accountability is not just about reporting their greening efforts but how they are ensuring their own green transition includes bringing the many workers within and not lead to mass retrenchments the gpc for sustainability and the environment had previously raised its concerns about how local businesses can survive and thrive as sustainability becomes more integrated into the global market ms foo said while sustainability efforts among companies here have picked up the lack of understanding of environmental sustainability and related concepts has been a barrier to galvanising strong action she cited last year's ecosperity week where it was revealed that 250 chief executives of firms which have made net zero commitments were unsure of how to reach their goals there remain many companies especially our smes small and medium sized enterprises which have yet to come on board the green economy bandwagon many consider sustainable practices as regulatory requirements they lack the understanding of their impact on their business and how to make the green transition yet this is one of the most significant business opportunities that they can tap for future growth said ms foo mr derrick goh nee soon grc observed that businesses will experience higher operating costs and capital expenditures as they look to lower their carbon footprint the higher costs can come from changes in regulations such as energy efficiency requirements and the carbon tax as well as supply chain disruptions he also said companies will need the expertise to properly measure their carbon footprint and emissions and getting this done is not easy even for a sophisticated corporate mr wee noted that sustainability reporting is an emerging area and companies will need references and resources to guide them in their disclosures he noted that isca is also developing a series of guides to share best practices on green and sustainable finance those guides will include a road map to guide professional accountants on obtaining green finance for their organisations if those fit into their corporate business strategy and guidance on how businesses can disclose their green finance policies and initiatives with such assessment this will allow companies to better approach banks for the financing of their sustainability

correct carbon price will guide investment decisions and spur companies to decarbonise but it will also come with higher costs for businesses and consumers we should calibrate and pace the adjustment

facilities producing 25 000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year covering 30 to 40 large emitters that contribute 80 per cent of singapore's greenhouse gas emissions smaller emitters those emitting at least 2 000 tonnes of emissions already have to pay the costs of monitoring and measuring their emissions given that any additional compliance costs would likely be minimal it makes sense for the carbon tax to cover all reportable facilities said mr ng this would after all be in the spirit of a whole of nation fight against climate change emitters small and large have a role to play in response minister for sustainability and the environment grace fu said the carbon tax currently covers about 80 per cent of singapore's emissions if we include the excise duties on vehicular fuel more than 90 per cent of our emissions are subject to a carbon price this coverage is one of the highest in the world she said adding that singapore will continue to encourage small emitters to track their carbon footprint on a voluntary basis greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane are produced by human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels when these gases accumulate in the atmosphere they trap heat on the planet throwing earth's systems out of whack and causing climate change the result rising temperatures and sea levels and more intense extreme weather events that can destroy lives and livelihoods a carbon tax is a means of assigning costs to the release of these planet warming emissions ms fu noted that over the past few months the government has consulted businesses and engaged the public on the need for and the potential impact of a higher carbon tax as part of the government's review of the post 2023 carbon tax level and trajectory the minister for finance will announce the outcome of our review at budget 2022 she said ms fu who represented singapore at the cop26 united nations climate summit in the scottish city of glasgow last november pointed out that a higher carbon price will keep singapore's carbon tax trajectory in line with the broader international momentum on climate action this will support the review of our climate targets she said at cop26 almost 200 nations agreed to revisit and strengthen their 2030 climate targets to align with the paris agreement temperature goal by the end of this year under the paris agreement countries should take steps to limit global warming to well below 2 deg c preferably 1 5 deg c above pre industrial levels climate scientists have shown this threshold will help the world avoid harsher climate impacts which become more severe with every degree of warming singapore's current target is for its emissions to continue to increase until 2030 when they reach their peak before they start to decline but the united nations has recommended that for the world to have a better chance at limiting warming to the 1 5 deg c target emissions must be nearly halved by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach net zero by 2050 ms fu said singapore will prioritise domestic efforts to cut its emissions but noted that low carbon technologies such as using clean burning hydrogen as a fuel are not yet immediately deployable there is significant uncertainty associated with these options at the moment given that their commercial success hinges on factors such as technological maturity and transboundary cooperation which are not entirely within our control she noted thus having access to international carbon markets which allows the country to buy carbon credits from projects elsewhere that either prevent the release of emissions renewable energy projects or absorb them forest conservation projects will complement singapore's toolkit for meeting its climate commitments added the minister the latest motion follows the first one that was debated in february last year which saw the house agreeing that climate change was a global emergency and the government should accelerate efforts to mitigate its impact ms poh said the green sector is developing rapidly in response to the climate emergency there are many new and exciting opportunities in the green economy particularly in green financing and many new job roles in the sustainability sector added the deputy chairman of the government parliamentary committee for sustainability and the environment central to our transition to a green economy our priority is to ensure singaporeans are not left behind as the world progresses towards a sustainable future and economy ms poh said we need to create fulfilling

formation of the multi ministry task force mtf on covid 19 as health minister when a pandemic loomed it was his idea to assemble a group which has become the face of singapore's fight against the covid 19 virus it was also mr gan who nominated finance minister lawrence wong as someone he could work well with to be his fellow co chair together they helmed singapore's pandemic response until may last year when the new health minister mr ong ye kung came on board i'm the new one the booster after the two primary doses said mr ong quips like this and other never before revealed details of how singapore dealt with a still unfolding crisis are in a new book published by straits times press that chronicles the past two years released on thursday jan 20 in this together singapore's covid 19 story goes behind the scenes to lift the curtain on among other things the origins of the task force and the dynamics of how ministers and civil servants worked together to tackle a formidable but invisible foe the government machinery swung into action as early as jan 2 2020 when news spread of an infectious disease of zoonotic origin occurring in wuhan china at the ministry of health moh singapore's director of medical services kenneth mak chaired a meeting where a decision was taken to ramp up the nation's surveillance and readiness an advisory was dispatched to all doctors to be on the watch for patients from wuhan who had pneumonia temperature screening was set up for visitors arriving at changi airport and singaporeans mostly still blissfully unaware were urged to be vigilant and observe personal hygiene singapore raised its disease outbreak response system condition or dorscon from green to the more serious yellow on jan 21 the next day mr gan went to senior minister teo chee hean asking to form the mtf with mr wong co chairing it both requests were approved by deputy prime minister heng swee keat acting for prime minister lee hsien loong who was then overseas at a press conference announcing the task force the ministers were quizzed on whether it was a premature move why do we need to set up a task force are you overreacting to this virus one reporter asked famous last words right said mr wong in an interview for the book i think it turned out it was right that we moved quickly and decisively to get the system going singapore detected its first case of covid 19 the next day jan 23 at the same time that the task force was set up the homefront crisis executive group hceg was also convened this is a grouping of senior civil servants that comes together in times of crisis headed by permanent secretary for home affairs pang kin keong its role was to come up with proposals to the mtf and put those accepted into operation the mtf in turn reports to pm lee and the cabinet for major decisions the book notes that pm lee had to be kept in the loop but left most operational matters to the ministers in charge who knew their decisions had to align with his and the cabinet's overall way of thinking pm lee asked that the detailed daily reports received by the cabinet be made public on the moh website there's nothing secret about this he said transparency as far as possible was also part of the mtf's approach from the start said mr gan whatever we tell you is whatever we know he said we were prepared to be frank and upfront if we didn't know we said we didn't know and we'll go and find out speaking at separate interviews for the book mr gan and mr wong both used the same word enjoyable to describe what it was like to work together but political watchers sat up and took notice after a cabinet reshuffle in may last year sent a third co chair to the task force mr ong who had taken over the health portfolio from mr gan with mr ong and mr wong being bandied about in discussions about pm lee's successor would any rivalry extend to the handling of the pandemic mr wong dismissed any notion of competition ye kung has been on my speed dial even before i joined politics i have known him for years he said noting that he had taken over the role of principal private secretary to pm lee from mr ong we know each other very well there is no issue working together at all the goal of the task force is ultimately to land on some sensible consensus over any disagreements and differing points of view said mr ong it doesn't need to be acrimonious he added you don't have to strangle each other he and other ministers say in the book that any arguments were based on science evidence facts and data rather than emotions ideologies or political considerations in any case the prime minister had the final say some of the most intense debates among the ministers and the hceg revolved around border controls the circuit breaker and migrant worker dormitories for instance the civil service counselled that a lockdown be averted in view of its economic and social impact but i sensed the mtf after a while felt that it had to be done said mr pang chairman of the hceg it was one of the rare recommendations from the hceg that the ministers rejected in the book pm lee commends the civil service for a remarkable job and for trying its utmost even if the outcomes were not quite perfect civil servants and ministers alike have received equal amounts of brickbats and plaudits throughout the pandemic as early as during the circuit breaker pm lee detected considerable consternation and diminished morale among those in charge in the face of a virus seemingly capable of outfoxing them at every turn he recalled telling the ministers you don't know how things are going to turn out maybe for the better maybe not people may thank you for it people may later scold you for it but right now you have been elected you're here to do a job and your duty is to keep singaporeans safe just concentrate on that leave the rest and the consequences till later on just acquit yourself to your conscience and your responsibility i

other insights into the government's handling of the pandemic are in a new book chronicling singapore's experience with the pandemic in this together singapore's covid 19 story went on sale on thursday jan 20 interviews with mr wong and health minister ong ye kung also a co chair of the task force reveal how discussions on accepting and planning for covid 19 as endemic started as early as in 2020 the idea was raised with the public by mr wong only on may 28 last year in that same month mr ong discussed the matter at a closed door seminar with clinicians and doctors their positive response prompted mr wong mr ong and the third co chair trade and industry minister gan kim yong to jointly write an op ed to signal a change in strategy published in the straits times on june 24 it outlined a new normal of living with covid 19 involving self testing home recovery and resumption of travel but a raging delta variant had other ideas about a fortnight after the op ed large infection clusters saw singapore retreat to the tighter curbs it had loosened only in june with eating out banned again and gathering sizes capped at two mr wong acknowledges in the book that many singaporeans were understandably frustrated but the decision was not taken lightly a major consideration was the vaccination rate of just 50 per cent at the time with a significant proportion of seniors about 200 000 not inoculated many of these older people frequented hawker centres and wet markets where infections had spread from a cluster at jurong fishery port the concern was look if you just ride it through you will end up potentially with more seniors in hospital and quite a number of them succumbing to the illness said mr wong asked if the authorities had jumped the gun with their earlier messaging on living with covid 19 and raising hopes that the worst was over mr wong acknowledged that they had counted on high vaccination rates to bring case numbers down and help singaporeans start to live more normal lives but this view shifted as more evidence pointed to breakthrough infections in vaccinated people along with documented waning vaccine immunity the task force realised expectations of vaccines had been too high the book's writers said noting the harsh reality was that even if everyone were vaccinated case numbers would rise as long as society continued to open up recognising this meant accepting periodic controls to stop large surges of cases from leading to more hospitalisations and deaths which could overwhelm the healthcare system said mr wong that is why we realised we have to be very controlled in our reopening we have to continue with some sensible measures over the next few months public discontent snowballed as tens of thousands caught covid 19 and a home recovery scheme ran into serious logistical hiccups much angst was levelled at the task force with some demanding to know why the authorities seemed to be falling back on strict measures thereby abandoning the endemic scenario they had laid out it was left to prime minister lee hsien loong to step in to steady the ship according to the book in a speech in october he reassured singaporeans that the strategy remained to live with covid 19 and predicted a runway of up to six months to reach a new normal this was a state where infection numbers would remain stable at perhaps hundreds a day hospitals would go back to business as usual some curbs would be eased and people could resume activities while feeling comfortable in crowds since then headway has been made with the launch of several quarantine free vaccinated travel lanes and relaxed social limits but the omicron variant now poses more uncertainty for the future a future in which disease x lurks an as yet unknown virus that could be even deadlier in an interview for the book manpower minister tan see leng a medical doctor noted that in the last 20 years there have been five major epidemics or pandemics sars h1n1 ebola mers and now covid 19 the next one is a question of not if but when he said this is a wake up call for us to improve to tighten and to constantly pivot to make sure that contingency

        "content": "you may have seen blue bins around singapore where you can deposit recyclables glass paper plastic and metal items but do you know exactly what should go into them based on a recent national environment agency nea household recycling survey conducted among approximately 2 300 households in singapore 72 per cent of them were not aware that recyclables do not have to be sorted by type before they are placed in the blue recycling bins or recycling chutes starting in 2014 all new public housing blocks are fitted with dual chutes general and wet waste can be disposed of in the normal waste chute whereas clean recyclables like newspapers glass bottles metal cans and plastic containers can go directly into the separate recycling chute known as the centralised chute for recyclables with this system recyclables need not be sorted as they will be collected and sorted later at a materials recovery facility a significant proportion of the households surveyed was also not aware that certain items like lightbulbs reusables e g old clothing and soft toys and styrofoam items cannot be recycled through the blue recycling bins or recycling chutes in recent years nea found that 40 per cent of the contents collected in blue recycling bins could not be recycled they were not recyclable in the blue recycling bins and chutes or had been contaminated by food and liquid stains here s what to know if you want to play your part in recycling to recycle right or at least not let others efforts go to waste can i put used tissue paper and used food packaging in the blue recycling bins no used tissues should be discarded in general waste bins or chutes as for your food packaging it depends on its material and how soiled they are if your used food boxes are made of plastic empty and rinse them before recycling if they are too oily and dirty such as pizza boxes or pastry bags with oil stains and food debris discard them in the general waste bins or chutes instead remember food and liquid waste can attract pests if they are wrongly thrown into the blue bin they contaminate other recyclables in the bin when recyclables have been contaminated they have to be sent to the general waste pile where they are incinerated and added to the semakau landfill instead of being recycled at the current rate of disposal singapore's only operating landfill the semakau landfill is expected to be full by 2035 do i have to rinse empty shampoo bottles before throwing them won t this waste water you don't need too much water to rinse an empty shampoo bottle the reason for rinsing the bottles is to make sure they are free of any product remnants that may contaminate other items and make both the shampoo bottles and the other items unrecyclable what about old cassette tapes and stationery made of plastic or biodegradable plastic bags unlike plastic bags or plastic hangers and containers these are usually not made from one single material so they are harder to recycle for instance a pen may be made of rubber and metal parts too biodegradable plastics are not suitable for recycling alongside conventional plastics as their chemical composition is different from that of conventional plastics these bags contaminate the recycling process and should be discarded as general waste i have several glass bottles that i have no use for can i drop them into my hdb unit's recycling chute yes glass bottles such as wine bottles beer bottles condiment bottles and even skincare product bottles and jars can go into the blue recycling bin or chute but empty and rinse the bottles first before disposing of them this also applies to canned drinks and beverage cartons items that require too much washing like oil bottles however can be discarded as general waste to prevent glass breakage bag the glass bottles with other recyclables to cushion the landing when the glass items are placed in the recycling chute this way any breakage stays within the bag broken glass can still be collected by recyclers and processed into new bottles again can i leave metal cans and caps in the blue recycling bins yes most packaging made of metal can be recycled including food and beverage cans metal bottle caps and even aluminium trays and foil but empty and rinse them first so they do not contaminate the rest of the recyclables in the blue bin i don t need my old furniture clothing toys and shoes anymore can they be recycled no these items should not be disposed of in the blue recycling bins or chutes if they are still in relatively good and wearable or usable condition consider donating them to charity organisations like the salvation army thrift stores for bulky items such as mattresses and wardrobes call your town council for complimentary collection and disposal of bulk waste if you live in a hdb flat if you live in a private property contact the public waste collector serving your estate but you will be charged for bulky item removal and disposal you can also engage the services of licensed waste collectors from a list here can i recycle large household appliances like washing machines refrigerators and tvs these household appliances should not go into the blue recycling bins or even be placed beside them there are separate collection avenues for large household appliances under the national e waste recycling scheme implemented by the nea on 1 july 2021 information on electrical and electronic products which can be disposed of responsibly under the scheme as well as the various disposal avenues and locations can be obtained from the nea website these appliances are also available for complimentary one for one takeback of the same type upon delivery by retailers e g free takeback of unwanted washing machine upon delivery of a new one by the retailer what about e waste like computers batteries and lamps e waste should not go into the blue recycling bins or even be placed beside them but should be placed in e waste bins

lookout for these spore producing green sheets a moss like patch on a tree at bukit timah nature reserve he spotted in 2015 helped him to secure his name in flora history when the plant was confirmed as a species new to science gaolejeunea hoi is named after dr ho and is currently endemic to singapore it is found on some tree bases and exposed roots in the forests of bukit timah and nee soon the plant falls under the family of liverworts which are the cousins of mosses this species was one of nine plants fungus and algae published last year as new records or rediscoveries with more than half of them spotted at the nature reserve dr david middleton coordinating director of research and conservation at the singapore botanic gardens said dr ho had handed specimens of his find to two liverwort experts from china the two had joined the gardens to help with a project on cataloguing and describing all the plant species in singapore they closely studied the features of the plant to confirm that it was a new species after sequencing the genes they found that the species was the second one under the gaolejeunea genus which refers to a category of plants that are closely related previously only one known species found in china was classified under this category dr middleton said bukit timah nature reserve is already well protected and the gaolejeunea hoi will just carry on growing that's where it's meant to be as part of the cataloguing project called flora of singapore the new species will be included in a volume on bryophytes a group of plants that includes mosses and liverworts a total of 14 volumes will be born out of the 10 year project three of them an introductory volume one on the grass family and another on a group of flowering plants were published in 2019 among the other eight published discoveries last year five of them are new species recorded in singapore including the first red algae found in freshwater here another new record is a plant that belongs to the fig family but its identity had been a 16 year mystery this is because there are numerous species within the group and many of them look similar explained dr middleton but a name was recently given to the pulau ubin dwelling plant with some help from france and wasps some wasps are known to lay eggs inside figs and tiny wasps were observed inside the small figs of the pulau ubin plants after years of studying the plants the researchers here believed the plants were called ficus subulata they sent the figs to an expert in france and the scientist confirmed those insects are known to enter the ficus subulata figs the remaining three finds are rediscoveries which means they were previously thought to be nationally extinct among the rediscoveries is a ground orchid called the hairy jewel orchid which was last collected more than 120 years ago it was spotted in tengah forest in 2020 unlike the more flamboyant and showy orchids hanging from trees the hairy jewel orchid can tolerate low light and grow on the ground a mushroom the sculptured toadstool seen prominently perched near the base of a tree in bukit timah nature reserve in 2020 after it was last collected there in 1939 is another rediscovery dr middleton said discovering new species and records is exciting but added the goal is to understand the natural heritage and plant diversity of singapore in its entirety to best protect and conserve them the species which is endemic to singapore and related to mosses was spotted on tree bases and exposed roots in the forests of bukit timah and nee soon each of the leaf like bodies forming the green mat is no more than 1cm long and about 1mm wide the tiny spore producing plants thrive in damp environments this small population of three orchid plants was first found in bukit timah nature reserve in 2019 in the fully saturated soil of a freshwater swamp the plant is also native to johor and sumatra about 100 to 200 of these flowering plants can be found growing in the humid shade among large boulders in the primary forest of bukit timah nature reserve the plants cover a 20m by 70m area and were first spotted in 2020 this species is related to the gaolejeunea hoi and classified as a liverwort each of its tiny shoots can grow up to 3cm long it is a rare and poorly known species from south east asia with just five verified collections recorded so far it is considered critically endangered in singapore where these plants were discovered growing among other tiny flora on the buttress of a heritage tree in the singapore botanic gardens in 2020 collected several times between 2005 and last year from various patches of secondary forest in pulau ubin the messy plant was an enigma to scientists for years the ficus subulata is part of the fig family which comprises a large number of species this pulau ubin species is similar to a number of other types of plants found in singapore and malaysia making it difficult for scientists to pin down its identity it was eventually identified recently with the help of a scientist from france and some wasps this is the only known red algae species found in freshwater environments in singapore the rare red algae was discovered in 2018 in a forest stream of bukit timah nature reserve it was formerly thought to be found only in one location in pahang malaysia and its discovery in singapore suggests that the algae's distribution is not as restricted as previously thought this ground orchid was last collected in 1897 before it was found in tengah forest in 2020 some of the plants have been transplanted to the singapore botanic gardens and there are ongoing efforts to germinate seeds this species has tiny flowers unlike the more flamboyant orchids people are familiar with this prominent mushroom has a cap that ranges from 10cm to 27cm wide and a stalk up to 26cm high it was last collected from bukit timah nature reserve in 1939 until it was sighted in the nature reserve in 2020 near the base of a tree the coastal flowering plant was assessed as nationally extinct in 2008 but more than 10 of the plants were discovered at a reclaimed site in tuas in 2019 seeds and cuttings have been taken from the rediscovered plants and are being grown at the national parks board's native plant centre over 10 000 of the plant's seeds are kept in the singapore botanic

        "content": "singapore four of the nine nursery and farm tenants in bah soon pah road in yishun have only a few days left to find new homes as their tenancies expire at the end of the year the land that they sit on has been earmarked for residential development from next year some may close down permanently after more than 30 years there they cited problems finding suitable plots that are big enough for their plants to grow in and which are at locations that are more accessible to customers the other five tenants have managed to secure new plots but they said the labour shortage brought about by the covid 19 pandemic has delayed relocation plans they are hoping for more time to get contractors in to move their supplies and prepare the land to return it to the authorities this is despite the singapore land authority sla informing the tenants in bah soon pah road which is near the seletar and jalan kayu districts in july 2017 of the lease expiry the nine tenants comprise an organic farm and wholesale and retail nurseries the farm and three nurseries have not found new locations the space that most of them occupy ranges from 5 000 sq m to 32 000 sq m which is equivalent to 0 7 to 4 5 football fields in a statement to the straits times sla said that for the past 4 years various agencies have been engaging the tenants regularly to encourage them to secure replacement sites before their tenancies expire on dec 31 this year due to the urgent need to provide for the housing needs of singaporeans the tenants will be required to return their premises to the government when the tenancy expires so that the site can be developed for public housing the agency explained sla national parks board and singapore food agency have also launched various sites for tender since 2016 and affected tenants that are keen to continue business can bid for a plot sla added tenants have also been advised that they can source for rental of other suitable spaces such as shops warehouses or industrial units however some tenants pointed out that many of the plots available at tender exercises were unsuitable for plant nursery activities or were too far from the heartland where most of their customers are ban nee chen nursery for instance has not secured a new plot yet mr teng kai wei its corporate development lead said the nursery currently occupies a 32 000 sq m space we have tried seeking commercial properties but as the upkeep of plants requires natural lighting we have not been able to find a strategic location that is able to house them said the 34 year old its retail reach is currently focused on the heartland and relocating from its current location may put off residents from getting their garden supplies from the nursery added mr teng without a new place to move to the nursery would also not have the capacity to provide sufficient supplies for their retail outlets he noted in the event that we are not able to sustain our business model it will dishearten us to let go of our employees who have been with us for many years said mr teng adding that the nursery currently employs more than 120 singaporeans some tenants that are fortunate enough to secure a new plot are facing unexpected delays with the pandemic causing issues such as labour shortage mr jesse chua 35 business development and operations manager at nursery world farm said it would need about a year to move to its new location at sungei tengah and return the land to the authorities as a result of the manpower crunch the contractors we spoke to were not able to commence work before chinese new year due to ongoing projects he said furthermore due to safe management measures construction workers can no longer go to multiple job sites on the same day mr chua added that the perishable nature of their products makes it tough for tenants to temporarily rent warehouses while waiting for their new homes to be ready he was also concerned about whether the current predicament would affect the livelihoods of older workers as many businesses in the plant industry hire older singaporeans they may also lack other skill sets with time running out to complete reinstatement works and move out some tenants said they may have to end their businesses ms nancy ang 57 manager at pioneer garden services said her nursery found a suitable plot in june this year she had been looking for a plot since 2018 however the tender results would be announced only next month we will have no choice but to wind up our business of over 30 years if a time extension is not granted said ms ang adding that an extension of between 10 and 12 months would be needed to relocate and engage contractors to return the plot sla said some tenants have asked for more time till the end of chinese new year to complete their reinstatement works due to manpower and relocation site issues it added that their request for extension is being reviewed and will be responded to soon join

skills path a new skills based hiring initiative launched by linkedin in august this year supported by the national jobs council skills path promotes hiring based on skills rather than a candidate s educational qualifications or past experience ms pek applied for the talent and learning solutions consultant role offered by hiring company linkedin via skills path the world's largest professional network is a participating employer in the pilot phase of the skills path programme communicative and people oriented the 23 year old went on to complete two skill assessments in critical thinking and customer service that were matched based on the role she had applied for just two days later she received a message from a recruiter as a job seeker i found skills path useful in demonstrating the skills the hiring company was looking for this gives me a better idea of my suitability for the role from the start even though i didn t have prior work experience in a technology company going through the linkedin learning courses and skill assessments gave me the confidence to apply for the role she says the programme offers job seekers free linkedin learning courses based on their selected role allowing them to validate these skills with assessments before they submit their job application the skill assessments that job seekers can take include analytical skills attention to detail project management critical thinking and customer service and excel like other job seekers on the programme ms pek also had to undergo a screening process which included a written or video introduction with questions set by the hiring company before taking these assessments skills path offered me relevant linkedin learning courses that would match the role i was applying for such as building rapport handling difficult conversations and critical thinking these were really in depth each one took a few hours to complete my confidence grew in the process as i knew i was spending time on acquiring skills that the job required she says in september she received a job offer from linkedin despite it being her first venture into the tech industry ms pek was able to tap onto transferable soft skills that she had developed from her prior sales experience in her new role in singapore more than 12 companies including ntuc enterprise zuellig pharma ocbc bank zalora foodpanda and uob have joined skills path offering roles including data analyst sales development and customer service amongst others collectively these employers have received over 200 job applications upskilling and reskilling have taken on a renewed sense of urgency as the pandemic has widened the skills gap the mismatch between skills that employers want or need and skills the current workforce is currently equipped with the gap is especially wide for newly created roles in growth sectors such as e commerce biotech and logistics a major shift in traditional mindsets towards hiring is required in order to close the gap employers are starting to realise that new hires should be assessed based on their existing skill sets instead of just their paper qualifications and work history as there are various in demand soft skills transferable from one job to another other skills relevant to the job may be learned through on the job training and development by allowing job seekers to showcase their new skills acquired and be assessed through skills path recruiters can evaluate candidates in a more equitable way based on their skills proficiency like attention to detail project management and critical thinking which are critical for success in the fast evolving job market this skills based hiring process has paid off for ms pek according to her employer linkedin ms pek stood out for her commitment to upskill in order to pivot to a different role or industry and showed an ability to demonstrate transferable skills during the interview process uob which successfully hired a personal wealth executive through skills path said that hiring through skills path helps the bank to discover talents who have valuable skills to bring to the table mr jay chan the bank s head of talent acquisition said we are able to more easily identify quality candidates who are a right fit for the job roles at uob by using the skill assessments feature for candidates they can also better understand the skills needed before applying for a role through skills path this results in a smoother experience for both the employer and job seekers as we are aligned on the candidate s suitability and interest for the role furthermore assessing candidates based on skills instead of looking solely at experience or educational background helps to boost the confidence of job seekers especially mid career ones looking to make a switch to a new role or industry this is particularly useful in helping us to broaden the diversity of our talent pool he adds last year the singapore government worked with 240 partners from industry groups to recruitment firms to match job seekers and employers ms feon ang managing director at linkedin asia pacific says the transition to a skills based economy is not a task that can be solely undertaken by a single entity it will require a multi stakeholder approach and we are proud to see skills path as an example of a public private partnership that can help

and growing consumer demands for sustainability what do they all have in common they are changemakers after all in a time of continuous and rapid change more professionals than ever must be equipped to drive and navigate change whether they are students volunteers entrepreneurs specialists or business leaders of any age and background what they all have in common is a drive to bring about positive change for the world and as the world of work is increasingly oriented around projects project skills will be indispensable to changemakers seeking to drive impact just consider the three changemakers mentioned above while they face seemingly different challenges from sector scope and scale they are essentially dealing with projects think about it this way a project has a beginning and an end a team and stakeholders budget schedule and a set of expectations to be met says mr ben breen global head of construction and managing director asia pacific project management institute pmi so you can see how almost everything we do at work or even at home can be a project welcome to the project economy in which we will see rising demand for project management skills in the increasingly uncertain world we are in today these skills are required to sustain grow innovate and excel students need project management life skills to break through the clutter and rise above young professionals seeking to accelerate their professional development need to be supported by certifications specialised credentials and experiences employers need to invest in the workforce to upskill them and derive greater value from the human capital but what exactly is project management it refers to the use of knowledge skills tools and techniques that empower people to turn ideas into a reality at the workplace this can mean anything as diverse as developing software to improve business processes organising relief efforts after a natural disaster expanding into a new sales market or constructing a new property complex even the construction of ancient egyptian pyramids can be seen through the project management framework designed and built 4 500 years ago the pyramids of giza which housed massive tombs and temples for the egyptian pharaohs afterlife were a remarkable engineering feat and enigma today they still leave scientists wondering about the sheer effort and level of project management skills required to bring builders planners and raw materials together those early pyramid architects builders and engineers were probably the pioneering project managers these days project managers are found at every level and in every department in every organisation they could be managers contractors and independent consultants and there are millions more accidental project managers today those of us who may not be in formal project management roles but having to deal with projectified tasks and work on a regular basis and that is what makes project management skills a beacon of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world it offers consistent lifelong value for all things project and change mr breen adds whether you are in construction retail technology or finance project management skills are valuable to have with the volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous vuca times we live in the world around us is changing at a rapid pace we see work getting broken down in specific projects more and more workers are being hired grouped and regrouped according to the knowledge experience and capabilities they bring to the specific projects that deliver the most value to an organisation s stakeholders furthermore upskilling and reskilling have become a priority for workers during this period as many seek to switch careers or jump industries and as economic and technological changes quicken organisations have been investing more in upskilling the workforce so that they are able to adapt to change stay relevant and resilient according to pmi s talent gap report 25 million new project professionals will be needed around the world by 2030 in the asia pacific region alone recruiters are expected to fill two million project management related job roles over the next 10 years this is why even as there is a rising demand for project managers across industries those who are certified professionals also enjoy increased earning power conducted between march and june this year pmi s salary survey which involved more than 30 000 respondents in 40 countries showed that even with the ongoing covid 19 pandemic singapore respondents who hold pmi s professional pmp certification reported enjoying 13 per cent higher median salaries than their peers who did not have this certification singapore was one of the countries in south east asia where project professionals reported the highest median salaries at us 74 936 about s 102 250 project management skills and certification are for everyone at any stage of his career but it is particularly crucial for younger employees like those aged 35 and under who are starting their careers or mid career professionals looking to upskill to future proof their qualifications and learn evergreen skill sets to help them navigate the winds of change says mr breen the rising generation of project leaders is dynamically altering the workplace and boldly reshaping the future as per research conducted by pmi with youths 85 per cent of respondents worldwide aged 15 to 25 believe they can do bigger things given the opportunity these young changemakers are not letting a global pandemic deter them from forging a better tomorrow they represent the project managers of the future who demonstrate the ability to tackle problems with a naturally curious and collaborative mindset they are the future leaders helping to drive transformation and positive change across numerous industries with the objective of empowering this community pmi has partnered the asean youth organization ayo to raise awareness about the importance of project management among its 450 000 members the ayo is a foundation set up in jakarta in 2013 that aims to equip youth in asean with the skills knowledge and resources to help their local communities mr breen says that young changemakers can enrol in a variety of globally recognised certifications courses and trainings from pmi depending on their current professional career stage one example is kickoff a free 45 minute online course and toolkit that covers the basics of project management to help individuals with little to no project management experience work smarter and lead successful projects he adds as organisations continue to navigate the new normal the complexity of business initiatives tends to grow exponentially this creates a growing need for a workforce with the right agile skill sets such as quick decision making collaborating and reacting and adapting quickly to changes all of which can be learnt through taking pmi agile certifications it is also why he thinks that companies should provide employees with training and upskilling opportunities especially those with globally recognised certifications if they wish to develop and retain top talent as the leader in project management we aim to empower people to make ideas a reality and aim to bring the winning aspiration to life for changemakers of all ages

        "content": "singapore depending on whom you ask rochor could be an arts and heritage district a late night supper spot or a pitstop on the way to the nearby bugis area what it won't be called is 'home' but the launch of build to order bto flats in a coveted spot next to jalan besar mrt station means 960 households will be able to call the area just that once units are completed in 2028 the highly anticipated rochor bto project river peaks i and ii is the first to come under a new prime location public housing model that imposes stricter buying and selling conditions on hdb flat owners conditions include a 6 per cent subsidy clawback clause upon resale of the unit a 10 year minimum occupation period and a limited pool of resale buyers whose combined monthly household income does not exceed the prevailing amount now 14 000 these are aimed at encouraging home ownership and reducing the lottery effect a major point of discontent in the resale market where some first time buyers earn a handsome profit when selling their well located flats home seekers were seemingly undeterred by these conditions imposed on the rochor bto project as the four room flats the biggest room type on offer have drawn three times more applicants than units available just one day after the housing board put them on the market the fact that buyers will have to wait six years for these rochor flats to be completed significantly longer than the median 4 4 years appears to have not dampened demand the estimated floor area of the units is also slightly smaller than other bto flats in mature estates this begs the question are the stricter conditions under the prime location public housing model enough to curb the lottery effect the hdb's 6 per cent subsidy clawback is one of key measures in reducing windfall gains when owners sell their flats on the open market but property analysts are split over the effectiveness of the clause as there is no direct comparison of such a clawback in singapore's housing market all subsidies are factored in when units are launched as bto flats one analyst said the 6 per cent amount is a modest sum considering the potential capital appreciation of the rochor flats while another said it seems reasonable but most concur that many sellers will likely factor in the 6 per cent subsidy recovery amount into their selling price for instance if a four room flat is sold for 1 2 million the seller will have to return around 72 000 to the hdb but still pocket a profit of around 500 000 said ms christine sun senior vice president of research and analytics at real estate firm orangetee tie she added that a 1 2 million price tag for a four room unit in rochor is a conservative estimate as some four room resale units have been edging towards the 1 million mark in recent months huttons asia senior research director lee sze teck suggested charting a hypothetical situation to look at the potential price gains by using the closest comparable bto project telok blangah towers launched in 2007 the project is a stone's throw from the future greater southern waterfront where flats will come under the prime location public housing model the project was completed in 2013 and reached its five year minimum occupation period mop in 2018 and began transacting on the open market hdb data notes that four room resale flats ranged from 820 000 to 975 000 in the third quarter a potential price gain of 2 4 to 2 6 times the price in 2007 said mr lee if a similar gain of 2 4 to 2 6 times is assumed for the rochor four room flats owners would have to sell their units at 1 51 to 1 61 million added mr lee in this hypothetical situation after returning around 90 000 to 99 000 to the hdb owners could still pocket a profit of around 900 000 he said but mr lee warned that it is hard to predict price gains with certainty as there is no precedent for such flats under the prime location housing model the long completion timeline is also another factor as the rochor flats will only hit the resale market sometime in 2038 after factoring in the 10 year mop could another black swan event like the covid 19 pandemic throw a spanner in the works in those intervening 17 years taking inflation into account could million dollar price tags for hdb units not raise eyebrows in 2038 the prime location public housing model came on the back of all time high hdb resale flat prices and a record number of million dollar flat sales in a year sparking concerns of home affordability for common folk this is particularly so as construction for bto flats the most affordable public housing options for singaporeans has been hit with delays of up to 10 months due to supply and manpower shortages arising from the pandemic but only time will tell if the stricter

prime location public housing plh model which come with a 6 per cent subsidy clawback clause upon their resale the units are spread across nine housing projects in six estates with a median waiting time of 4 4 years for flats to be completed in addition another 1 798 flats were on offer in this year's second and final sale of balance flats sbf scheme in total 6 299 new flats were launched on wednesday the highly anticipated plh project river peaks i and ii in rochor comes with stricter buying and selling conditions a total of 960 three room and four room flats are on offer across six 47 storey blocks one of the blocks will include 40 two room rental flats the project sits on two plots of land along weld road and kelantan road and is directly connected to jalan besar mrt station prices start from 409 000 without grants for a three room flat and 582 000 for a four room flat making them the most expensive units in a mature estate in this launch the prices are slightly higher than those in august's queenstown bto project queen's arc where the price of a three room flat started from 382 000 and a four room flat from 540 000 the estimated floor area of the rochor units is also slightly smaller with three room units at 66 sq m each and four room units at 88 sq m each in queen's arc three room units have an approximate floor area of 69 sq m each with four room units at 93 sq m each under the plh model owners of these rochor flats will pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation whichever is higher to hdb when they sell their home on the open market for the first time the subsidy clawback applies to only the first resale transaction and does not apply to subsequent resales this is because hdb has to provide additional subsidies on top of those provided for all bto flats in order to launch these prime area flats at affordable prices all subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as bto flats in order to prevent excessive windfall gains when owners sell their flats on the open market hdb said it will claw back the additional subsidies this also means that owners who choose not to sell their flats will not get their subsidies clawed back owners will also be subject to a 10 year minimum occupation period up from the five years for other flats before they can sell their flats on the open market this comes on top of the 71 months just under six years estimated waiting time for these flats as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2028 the longer construction time for the rochor project is due to the height of the blocks and the proximity to jalan besar mrt station which require more preparation work as well as compliance with more stringent requirements by the authorities this means owners will likely be able to resell these flats only some time in 2038 the pool of resale buyers of these rochor flats will also be limited to households which earn not more than 14 000 a month with at least one applicant being a singapore citizen the plh model to ensure that new public housing in prime central locations will remain affordable accessible and inclusive for singaporeans comes after almost a year of public consultations at least one prime location housing project will be launched each year although the proportion of flats will differ year on year to ensure a diverse supply across estates

        "content": "jabed pasha had always wanted to be an automotive engineer ever since he could remember his favourite movie series the fast and the furious with special mention to 2006 s tokyo drift his favourite car the nissan skyline r34 gt r three different models all different sizes but each in blazing electric blue sit in various parts of his college dorm room he has always wanted to make these mechanical beasts tick breathing life into their roaring engines and feeding power into their transmissions what he jokingly refers to as hardcore engineering but that all changed with his admission to the hong kong polytechnic university s polyu faculty of engineering in 2019 being exposed to different modules in the programme made him realise that maybe he didn t want to make cars he wanted to design them instead the bachelor of engineering honours in mechanical engineering mr pasha explains has two schemes mechanical engineering and product analysis and engineering design in their first year students admitted to the mechanical engineering scheme take foundational courses that are common to most of the faculty of engineering such as fundamentals of physics mathematics and information technology their second year sees them take a mix of modules from both programmes introducing students from the mechanical engineering scheme to modules from the product analysis and engineering design scheme and vice versa a traditional mechanical engineering student mr pasha was first introduced to product analysis and engineering design when he took courses in visualisation and communication the first in particular involved his team analysing the specifications of a massage pillow finding justifications for why specific parts were used why it possessed or omitted certain features and why these design choices were good or bad ones at the end of the course his team created a 3d model of an improved working prototype and presented their findings to their professors and industry experts it was at that moment when mr pasha s course of study came to a turning point i realised that i actually wanted to do product design he recalls the whole time i thought i wanted to make cars but i slowly came to realise that what really interested me was the product development process in order to give students like mr pasha more flexibility in their studies at polyu the university is revising several aspects of its curriculum recognising the importance of innovation and technology in industry 4 0 polyu has incorporated two new elements artificial intelligence and data analysis and innovation and entrepreneurship as part of its general university requirement courses which students must fulfill prior to graduation furthermore the university is also implementing a new departmental scheme based admission for new entrants the admissions process is currently programme based in the existing system students apply directly to and are admitted to their intended major but starting from the 2022 2023 academic year students will first apply to one of the 11 departments in polyu ranging from the department of applied sciences to construction and environment and fashion after successfully enrolling in a department they only have to undertake said department s common courses in their first academic year major selection only takes place in students second academic year for instance an applicant accepted into the department of computing needs only to choose to specialise in one of the three available majors computer science enterprise and information systems or financial technology and artificial intelligence by the beginning of their second year the aim of the departmental scheme based admission is to give students more time to learn more about their interests and aspirations so as to let them make a more informed choice about their eventual major selection like mr pasha chua hui ying found herself at a crossroads when it came time to decide her path in the department of chinese and bilingual studies at the time there were three major tracks linguistics translation and communication ms chua was torn between specialising in either of the latter two in the end it was her experiences outside the classroom that ended up swaying her decision the first was an international business development internship at sustainable living startup green monday where ms chua conducted research on target consumer bases in the company s overseas markets aside from establishing contacts with potential collaborators in overseas markets a major part of her job was also helping to create material aimed at consumers in taiwan and china where her experience in translation came in useful i would have to understand what my local colleagues were trying to convey in their initial draft presentations and translate it into a register that was more appropriate for the target audience says ms chua she also embarked on research at the university of hong kong where she interviewed foreign women on the difficulties of living in the city many of them she recalls not only faced difficulties overcoming language barriers but also financial issues such as not being able to afford childcare while very different these two experiences made her realise that communication on the most fundamental level was something that she wanted to specialise in ms chua is aiming for a career in corporate communications but says she is still in the process of discovering herself there are a lot of opportunities in different companies here in hong kong she says interestingly despite his earlier revelation mr pasha now in the third year of his studies opted to stay on the mechanical engineering track instead of switching over to product analysis and engineering design i actually think mechanical engineering is a better option for me right now he says having broader based mechanical engineering knowledge lets me be in touch with the whole line of development like conducting research or mechanical testing and not specifically developing a specialised product besides he reasons if he wanted to get more experience in product design down the line he can do so via polyu s wealth of research and internship opportunities to date he has had the opportunity to intern at local startup cuphouse designing modelling and 3d printing mechanical components for assistive devices for the disabled he has also conducted remote research at the university of jordan running fluid dynamics simulations on blood flow in patients with increased arterial fatty deposits that s the thing i find best about polyu he says there s just so many opportunities you want to do something there s a way you can do it looking to apply to the hong kong polytechnic

        "content": "education minister chan chun sing will be remembered for his address to a class of university graduates last year where he told them that the grand ceremonies that universities hold for those completing their degrees are likely to become a relic of the past he also told the students that their degree scrolls which indicate the specific degree they undertook and the date of completion will also become outdated in the future explaining his remarks to the straits times he stressed that the rapid pace of change under way will push students to keep updating their knowledge and building new skills hence once they enrol in an institution they will never graduate just once but will go on to have a lifelong relationship with their alma mater he said universities will offer more flexibility and grant their students unlimited credits allowing them to take as many modules as they want throughout their lifetime students can take up courses at any point of their working life when they need to acquire new skills and knowledge and they would study alongside students of all ages using many modes be they offline or online on campus or at the workplace mr chan added in the future it will also be unthinkable that students would graduate with a degree in engineering or a degree in business these subjects will not be taken in isolation what will be of value will be relevant skills and knowledge to solve real problems rather than artificial silos of content in his wide ranging interview on education and institutes of higher learning which he kept referring to as institutions of continuous learning or icls he spoke about what else will change in higher education a the use of terms such as institutes of higher learning or higher education sector is not inherently intuitive after all learning is learning it is arguably ambiguous to classify learning as higher or lower i prefer to call them institutions of continuous learning and these include universities polytechnics the institute of technical education and all other institutions where you go to further your education a the pace of change has accelerated just look at product cycles of our phone every year there's a new model with even more advanced features similarly many of the jobs that are emerging may not yet exist in the lexicon of today's world for example not many years ago we would not have heard of ux design user experience design if you walk down the street from here ministry of education building in buona vista to one north you'll find all kinds of jobs that didn't exist just a few years ago this requires students to keep going back to icls to upgrade their knowledge and skills and we need flexibility in our system to allow students to take up different modules and extend their studies if necessary a there needs to be a mindset shift our students must move away from frontloading their education they should build a strong foundation and then use continuous learning to build on that further most importantly they must acquire the ability and mindset to learn unlearn and relearn the universities are moving towards a modular building block system where students can take different modules according to their interests or based on the shifting demands in the market say you have a student who wants to try his hand at entrepreneurship with this system the student can go off and develop their entrepreneurial ventures and come back and plug into the system at any point in time in the future they would have gained valuable skills and experience and be clearer about what modules they want to take this also helps the institutions be more targeted in what they deliver so i think this will be the landscape going forward and i think more and more of our students will want to do this not everyone has to fit into the traditional route or pathway i am prepared to have students chart their own paths and enable them to discover new breakthroughs a we need to move beyond what we call the cpr or cohort participation rate if we have continuous learning for life then we should have a lifetime cohort participation rate and it would not matter whether you go for a degree diploma or some professional certificate or at what age you do so we need to build a system that can support our students and workers to do just in time learning where learning is available on demand and can be accessed when the learner needs it young people will keep upgrading without calling it a degree necessarily so this whole concept of cpr is increasingly less relevant to our needs as a society going forward in fact i'm seeing more and more singaporeans who are not interested in that full degree or diploma programme they are very targeted very selective in going after those modules that give them an edge in the job market so for example if you are already in a job for quite a few years specialising in cyber security you may need to take up courses that give you very specific skill sets in certain operating systems i've seen more and more of these adult learners opting for these specialised modules and i think it's a good sign because then we move away from this whole thing that it must be a diploma or a degree a yes our schools post secondary and tertiary institutions offer many more choices at the secondary level you have the singapore sports school school of the arts and the nus high school of math and science you also have different programmes from the international baccalaureate to the integrated programme gce o levels and gce a levels and at all levels i think we will increasingly have more diverse options for our people because we are no longer adopting a one size fits all approach in fact we are in the process of mass customising to bring out the best in everyone but i think our mission and our sense are that our success is not defined by some metrics or numbers our success is whether each and every child can fulfil his or her potential many of the leading edge frontier companies have their own training institutions and we should not shy away from partnering with them especially when it comes to continuing education because increasingly this thing about a degree and a diploma is just one frame of thinking about higher education it is really the skills the currency of knowledge that are more important why shouldn't we work with the googles of the world to learn the latest things that they are doing they may not offer a full degree programme or a full diploma programme but they certainly offer valuable modules that our adult learners want to take up a all institutions and schools even pre schools play an important role not just universities if you are born a singaporean so long as you are capable you're committed and you're prepared to work you will have every chance of success regardless of your starting point i come from a single parent family and was able to progress partly because of the opportunities i had in the education system being the minister for education today i want to be able to say to every student that even if you come from a family like mine or a family with much more challenging circumstances you can also have the chance to succeed in singapore that is our commitment to our people we need to make sure that we have multiple pathways of success for different children with different abilities and instil confidence in themselves confidence in their future and the confidence to contribute to our society a i am not sure my university experience would be relevant to youth today but one of the things i did while in university was to minimise the amount of time i spent on my degree studies and maximise the amount of time that i spent on subjects beyond that i studied economics in cambridge but i read up on biology behavioural science history and many other things that were not directly related to the degree courses that i was taking i wanted that span of knowledge and inquiry and i wanted new tools to help me think about the issues of the world so my advice to the students that i meet is always this that it is one thing to get your diploma and degree and pass the exam to meet and fulfil the requirements that in itself is necessary and good but don't be constrained by that we must develop a lifelong passion of inquiry to learn things beyond what is covered in exams and that really enriches your perspective and helps you to have a much richer understanding of the subjects that you are studying mr chan chun sing was appointed singapore's

charge of muslim affairs masagos zulkifli such pictures in the book red lines political cartoons and the struggle against censorship are offensive to muslims even if they are published in the name of free speech academia or otherwise stressed mr masagos in parliament on wednesday jan 12 beside the caricatures of the prophet and islam the book also included images insulting to other religions the authors may say that they do not intend for the publication to be insulting or demeaning and their intention is to educate but the government rejects that he said the infocomm media development authority imda said last november that the book published in august will not be allowed to be sold or distributed here as it has been classified as objectionable under the undesirable publications act for containing content that denigrates religions this includes reproductions of french magazine charlie hebdo's cartoons of prophet muhammad which led to protests and violence overseas as well as denigratory references pertaining to hinduism and christianity the book by hong kong baptist university's professor of media studies cherian george and graphic novelist sonny liew has already been distributed in other countries like the united states it examines political cartoons from all over the world and explains the various motivations for and methods of cartoon censorship the demeaning and insulting images of the prophet has led to rioting and deaths in several parts of the world noted mr masagos and major publications have refrained from publishing these offensive pictures singapore's harmonious race and religious relations require constant care and attention of the government and the society at large and it is vital that every faith is treated with respect he added we don't want to risk anything that will begin unravelling the peace and harmony we enjoy from the due respect and consideration everyone gives to others said mr masagos we remain committed to working closely with all our religious communities to preserve and strengthen our racial and religious harmony which is a bedrock of our cohesive society on wednesday minister for communications and information josephine teo also spoke about the book and stressed that the government does not allow any religious group to be insulted or attacked as hate speech and offensive content can easily be normalised and lead to deep social divides if left unchecked to preserve racial and religious harmony in singapore we take a firm stance on such content regardless of their purpose of publication she said mrs teo pointed out that in the last five years the government had assessed six other publications besides red lines to be objectionable for denigrating various religious communities these publications and others not allowed for distribution in singapore were assessed to be likely to cause feelings of enmity hatred ill will or hostility between different racial or religious groups ms tin pei ling macpherson asked if the political nature of the cartoons in red lines played a part in the decision to disallow it from being distributed here to this mrs teo said that political cartoons were not in themselves a problem and some are already in circulation she reiterated how the government has not allowed six other books to be distributed here for similar reasons in the last five years none of them were about politics either they either contained offensive and prejudicial content about other religions or espoused polemical religious teachings which were likely to cause ill will and hatred among the different religious groups in singapore she said red lines is objectionable for similar reasons the book s distributor as well as its authors have not confirmed their specific plans on the treatment of the offensive content said mrs teo if and when they do so they can approach imda to assess the suitability of a revised version for distribution here she added prof george said yesterday that before their distributor approached imda he and mr liew had decided they should make some redactions for copies destined for singapore bookstores out of respect for local norms we were waiting for imda s inputs before doing the edits but the government banned the book instead we intend to proceed with the changes that we had in mind before the ban he said responding mrs teo s press secretary dawn tay said the book was launched in the united states on august 31 two months before imda s decision on nov 1 to disallow the publication for distribution in singapore even now more than two months later imda has not received any confirmation on specific plans to address the offensive content in the book from the authors or distributor ms tay added on wednesday the ministry of home affairs said that it will not allow offensive cartoons like those in charlie hebdo to be published here regardless whether the cartoons are about christianity islam buddhism hinduism or other religions such images even if intended as social commentary or for discussion on the issue of censorship have the potential to cause offence to various religious communities it said the caricatures in the 'red lines' book will in our view be deeply offensive to different religious groups regardless of why these cartoons are dealt with in the book and regardless of the authors intent in publishing them said the ministry the multi racial and multi religious harmony that we enjoy in singapore today is not the natural order of things it is a state that we have worked hard to achieve and carefully

        "content": "singapore second minister for finance indranee rajah and minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling addressed mps' questions about inflation and the goods and services tax gst hike in parliament on tuesday jan 11 here are edited excerpts of the questions and answers given the series of cost increases in recent months and with perhaps more to come and that we are still in this pandemic fighting mode would the government consider delaying the gst increase to avoid adding to inflationary pressure there are two distinct aspects of that question one is can we delay the date that gst takes effect but the second and the much more important question is can we delay the impact of that increase on singaporeans for the first one we had announced in budget 2018 that we plan to raise the gst by 2 percentage points from 7 to 9 per cent and it will be some time from 2021 to 2025 then the pandemic came along so we said in 2020 that the gst rate increase would not take place in 2021 in direct recognition of the hardship felt by people it's not something we can put off forever but the exact timing was something we have to think about in deciding the timing for the gst hike we are carefully considering all the overall economic conditions the economy is recovering steadily and barring fresh disruptions it should grow in step with global economic recovery and we expect gdp to grow by 3 to 5 per cent in 2022 this brings me to the second question which is irrespective of whatever date gst takes effect can we delay the impact on singaporeans we have designed it such that yes we can delay the impact on singaporeans through the assurance package for the majority of singaporeans we will delay the impact for them effectively by five years and for the lower income the impact on them will be delayed effectively for 10 years so the date that it takes effect and the date that the impact is felt are two separate things and we will continue to look out for the low income households and the majority of middle income households will mti work with some ministries to coordinate some of the increases where it's within the control of the government for example electricity prices that affect a majority of people even the coffee shops are now using that as an excuse to increase drink prices the ministry of trade and industry mti and competition and consumer commission of singapore cccs take a tough stance against profiteering and we keep a very close watch on prices mti monitors the general price movements through the department of statistics the cpi consumer price index survey and where necessary mti also monitors the prices of specific goods if you recall about 20 months ago between january and may 2020 there was a surge and very very high demand for masks during that period mti and cccs swung into action we monitored the prices of the masks on a weekly basis we took proactive actions and sought price information from e commerce platforms that helped shape behaviour by the retailers and organisations back in 2006 the government had put in place a freeze in fee increase for one year after the gst increase this time round will the government consider a similar freeze we will do our best but we cannot defer fee increases forever if and when we do have to have fee increases we will do our best to ensure that singaporeans are supported and buffered against such increases inflation affects different demographic groups differently so i'm wondering if mti is studying and will publish cpi indicators for different demographic groups for example parents with young children will have expenditures on diapers and milk powder which other demographic groups will not elderly people living alone empty nesters will have certain healthcare expenditures that other groups do not we monitor the cpi all items inflation based on different household income groups that allows us to work with the ministry of finance to design the necessary targeted assistance for the relevant segments based on household income in the third quarter of 2021 the cpi all items inflation came in at 1 9 per cent year on year for the lowest 20 per cent income group 2 2 per cent for the middle 60 per cent income group and 3 per cent for the highest 20 per cent income groups this shows that households in the lowest 20 per cent income group experienced lower inflation compared to the other income groups is the government veering towards the formation of anti profiteering committees as a way to track prices and how they affect our people on the ground what has been the government's progress on lowering regulatory costs for businesses as a way of combating inflation the first strategy is working hard to keep our economy competitive to create good paying jobs that generate real wage growth for singaporeans it's about providing conditions for companies especially local smes small and medium sized enterprises to sustain income growth that outpaces inflation where necessary we will intervene in terms of monitoring prices it is also about lowering barriers to entry where possible so singaporeans enjoy competitive prices we remain focused on diversifying our sources of supply expanding our sources of food supply can the government assure singaporeans that we can continue to monitor the situation and decide on targeted measures to help specific groups on the question of whether we will continue to design targeted measures the answer is yes we've been taking feedback we're looking to see what we can do to support households and that is something that members can look towards in budget 2022 correction note this article incorrectly quoted minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling on how the ministry of trade

        "content": "singapore singapore is likely to soon see a significant wave of covid 19 cases as the more infectious omicron variant spreads through the community which could strain its healthcare capacity to protect seniors and healthcare workers the authorities will suspend in person visits to all hospital wards and residential care homes for a period of four weeks from jan 24 to feb 20 it will also expand the national booster programme to cover those aged 12 to 17 and adjust health protocols to allow more groups of patients assessed to be low risk to self isolate and recover at home including children aged five to 11 existing safe management measures such as dining in groups of five will also be maintained through the chinese new year festive period to lower the risk of transmission and reduce the stress on the healthcare system said trade and industry minister gan kim yong on friday jan 21 mr gan noted at a press conference that about 70 per cent of daily cases are now of the omicron variant which has become the dominant strain in place of delta this proportion could be even higher close to 90 per cent or more he added so far most of the omicron cases have been mild especially among those who have been fully vaccinated and even more so for those who have received a booster shot said the minister who co chairs the multi ministry task force handling the pandemic as a significant proportion of the workforce may be infected with covid 19 businesses should put in place robust continuity plans to mitigate disruptions to their operations particularly those in the essential services mr gan added finance minister lawrence wong who co chairs the task force with mr gan and health minister ong ye kung said it is very likely that the omicron peak will exceed the previous peak from the delta variant noting that the authorities have said the omicron wave could rise to 15 000 daily cases mr wong said it is very possible that the peak may well be higher than that other countries have seen an omicron infection rate of about 400 infected persons per 100 000 persons he said now if you translate that to singapore's population we are talking easily 20 000 to 25 000 infected cases a day added mr wong but he stressed that the focus should not be on headline infection numbers but on the number of people who are severely ill and who need hospital or intensive care and in that regard we are hopeful that we can ride through this omicron wave without having to tighten our measures he said mr gan acknowledged that many people have hoped for safe management measures smms to be relaxed ahead of the holiday period however it is important that we continue with our existing smms to help prevent overloading our healthcare system even as we experience a surge in cases from the omicron variant he said this means that the permitted group size for chinese new year remains at five people with households allowed to receive only five unique visitors a day restaurants are also not allowed to take bookings for multiple tables of five unless all members are from the same household to free up hospital capacity for the impending omicron wave the ministry of health moh will reduce the isolation period for fully vaccinated people who are unwell and have tested positive to a maximum of seven days down from 10 days currently the same applies to children under 12 this is because studies from the national centre for infectious diseases have shown that people with omicron infections have a lower viral load than if they had been infected by the delta variant however unvaccinated people will still have to be isolated for 14 days if infected people will also be allowed to leave isolation earlier if they are recovering well and if symptoms have improved even if they are warded in treatment facilities these changes enable us to deal more nimbly with omicron and minimise disruption to normal activities for fully vaccinated and boosted persons even as case numbers continue to rise said moh the rules will also be eased for travellers arriving on vaccinated travel lane flights from monday jan 24 as imported cases form a shrinking proportion of singapore s total cases they will no longer need to take antigen rapid tests daily for a week after their arrival only on days when they wish to go out and if they test positive they will not have to take a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction test instead they are simply required to self isolate for 72 hours before checking again to see if they are now negative mr ong also reiterated the importance of vaccination stressing that unvaccinated people have a disproportionately large impact on the healthcare system if they contract covid 19 he acknowledged that delta is more severe than omicron where studies have shown that infections are much less severe for those who have been vaccinated received their booster shots or recovered from natural infection but we are not so sure that the same is true for individuals who are unvaccinated and covid naive asked what singapore would do when the country hits the peak of the omicron wave the ministers replied that the country would make decisions based on the situation then mr ong said singapore is using the situation in britain south africa and the united states as reference points and that the omicron wave in these countries took four to six weeks to peak omicron is so transmissible so when the numbers are so huge at some point you ve run out of people to infect and then you will start to come down he added but he also pointed out that every country is different and that some have had many prior infections or lower vaccination levels than singapore there are certain expectations that we have a plan we plan beforehand that on this day this time we will do this or that based on certain metrics said mr ong but actually we are in a fog of war every variant is different and behaves differently and you just

swab to an only son stoic amid the loss of his mother the straits times st picture desk has documented the coronavirus and its impact on singapore since it struck in january 2020 some of its work illustrates in this together singapore's covid 19 story a new book published by straits times press that was released on thursday jan 20 about singapore's two year fight against the pandemic the selections below are accompanied by the reflections of the st photographers behind them i was expecting the general atmosphere to be tense and heavy but i was really heartened to see that the healthcare staff were positive and professional they go about their duties in a serious manner but they remain in good spirits if that's something i can feel i'm sure the patients can feel it too like how viruses fear and panic are contagious so are love calm joy and kindness we've seen scenes like this all around the world now so it's perhaps not as shocking to see hospital staff in full personal protective equipment ppe two years on but my respect for the healthcare workers has only increased because while we all feel the pandemic fatigue they are right on the front lines and i don't think anyone of us can imagine the mental and physical stress they face daily in the second half of march 2020 social distancing stickers and tape started popping up all over singapore to encourage people to keep at least 1m away from one another it was surreal to see these appearing all over clean and neat singapore i thought this might not happen again and decided to record it in the beginning all i saw were marking strips of yellow black or red but people quickly became creative large or tiny stickers overlaid or otherwise some even came with jokes or handwritten notes worn out tape and stickers later showed how long the pandemic had gone on the malaysian government gave barely 24 hours' notice when it announced a two week nationwide travel ban in a bid to beat covid 19 it was a rude shock to more than 350 000 people who use the land crossing daily most of them malaysians working or studying in singapore i reached johor baru at about 7 30pm and started to photograph the chaotic jams following a stoic crowd who decided that walking across the causeway was faster than taking a car or bus at that moment who knew that the borders would end up closed for almost two years before the vaccinated travel lane vtl was put in place the last time the causeway shut down dates back to world war ii when the british bombed it in a futile attempt to stop the japanese advance this was where one of the first covid 19 clusters in migrant worker dormitories was identified it was one month into the lockdown and what you don't see in this picture are the frustrated yet curious eyes that greeted us when we got to the main courtyard which was as far as we were allowed to go the workers were asked to go back to their rooms as being in the general corridors was not encouraged looking at this picture i am reminded of the extremely frustrating and sorry situation that dormitory residents had to deal with it serves as a reminder of how good the rest of us have it and how some of the restrictions that affected our daily lives were incredibly first world problems compared with what migrant workers went through during those months the test collects a sample of nasal secretions from the back of the nose and throat causing discomfort to nerve endings that may elicit tears and coughing this bangladeshi migrant worker started tearing up after his swab at that point in time i had yet to experience a swab myself from the look of it the process seemed largely uncomfortable and i wanted visual evidence this photo was taken during a time when migrant workers were maligned and blamed for the number of covid 19 cases i had hoped that the photo could add to the discussion of their living environments provoking thought and challenging mindsets along the way the face represents for me one of the many covid 19 cases which arose in migrant worker dormitories that brought to light their overcrowded situation this was part of a feature called 'a city at a standstill' where the idea was to capture popular tourist spots shopping strips recreational facilities and other areas that were usually crowded before the pandemic we wanted to document what the country looked like from above with these drone photos looking at the photo now the emptiness of what we know as a 'bustling' city seems surreal as much as we enjoyed the space and peacefulness during the circuit breaker we hope the virus will be defeated soon and the world can reconnect once again this was when people were allowed back in their offices but dining out was not i had to find a picture to illustrate this transitioning phase and chanced upon these office workers stepping out of market street interim food centre with their purchases what stood out for me were the red plastic bags they were holding against the dark green backdrop it helped that they were all walking in one direction when i look at the picture now i feel that we are all still trying to play our part amid the pandemic head in one direction united but the destination remains unknown this was just before the meeting commenced i was in the room as the task force members came in and was allowed to take photos for around two minutes there was minimal room to manoeuvre physically so the challenge was to capture nuances in body language gestures and expressions that reflected the gravity of these meetings it was a rare opportunity to observe and take photos of politicians in a more candid setting compared with the staged or carefully orchestrated 'diary' events which i previously photographed them at it was heartbreaking for me to listen to mr ng's story about how his family could not say their last goodbyes to his mother during the portrait session i had asked mr ng to sit at the spot at the dining table where his mother used to have her meals i then gently asked him to think about his mother he tried to be stoic but was obviously holding back his emotions in front of us tears started to well up in his eyes but he didn't let them flow after covering the pandemic for two years and being consumed with news on the latest covid 19 numbers and emerging variants mr ng's story still deeply touches me and brings home the risk of infection it could happen to any of us the medical staff knew exactly what to do inside the ward and carried out their duties professionally i have the utmost respect for them because they are on the front line treating covid 19 patients taking care of them so that they can return to their loved ones in better health one day for this shoot i remember that a few days before i had to try five different models and sizes of n95 masks before 'passing' a mask fitting test i then had to declare a negative antigen rapid test result on each of the three days i went inside the hospital to take photos after every shoot i would use alcohol wipes to sanitise my equipment spray my shoes with sanitiser when i got to the doorstep of my house and shower and wash my clothes straightaway the virus may be invisible to the naked eye but it does not mean it does not exist in this together singapore s covid 19 story retails for 28 with gst at major bookstores it is

workers the last line of defence rather than front liners there are games where everybody just attacks and you're the only one left and at every counter attack you feel overwhelmed i thought that must be what a healthcare worker felt at that time said mr ong in a chapter titled battle in the hospitals where he talked about october last year when the covid 19 delta variant led to over 3 000 virus cases daily and the death toll climbed the rest of the society wants to move on but they were carrying the can mr ong's interview appears in the book in this together singapore's covid 19 story published by straits times press which lays out in 13 chapters singapore's multifaceted fight against the virus in the book launched on thursday jan 20 the chapter battle in the hospitals relates how the healthcare sector had to shoulder the lone massive responsibility of treating and caring for the infected from the moment the virus arrived in january 2020 at least until the home recovery scheme started late last year healthcare workers such as nurses also share stories about managing anxious and distraught family members who were kept away from their loved ones of being shunned by the public and feeling helpless and overwhelmed when patients died when the delta variant began wreaking havoc from august last year there was no time to rest for healthcare staff like singapore general hospital assistant nurse clinician chester chow 32 he recalls in the book how he could be in a room with a critically ill patient for up to three hours carrying out one procedure after another and sometimes family members would take out their frustrations on the staff at different points in time some of us wanted to give up mr chow told journalists from the straits times but we talked supported and encouraged one another paranoia over healthcare workers being contaminated with the virus also spilled over at the initial stages of the pandemic causing some to avoid wearing their uniforms while taking public transport national university hospital senior staff nurse nathanael tan was in regular clothes when he hailed a taxi to work one day yet he was quizzed by the driver on why he was going to the hospital's emergency department before the cabby eventually allowed him to board the cabby kept his windows down for the entire trip said mr tan 30 the number of abuse or harassment cases reported by public healthcare workers rose from 1 200 in 2019 to 1 400 as at the end of november last year while 1 500 workers resigned in the first half of 2021 compared with 2 000 annually before the pandemic but singaporeans have by and large rallied behind healthcare workers with recovered patients interviewed for the book expressing appreciation and recognition for them as heroes of the pandemic the private healthcare sector also chipped in to alleviate the burden on public institutions in january 2020 ihh healthcare singapore the largest private group here was called on to set up screening for travellers at 10 land and sea checkpoints within 24 hours the group tapped its pool of over 5 000 employees to man the checkpoints with chief operating officer noel yeo doubling up as a temperature screener as well as a medical doctor assessing cases he reveals in the book ihh's mount elizabeth hospital also took in covid 19 patients and provided manpower to take swab samples at worker dormitories and staff the community care facility at singapore expo ihh and other private medical groups were also roped in for the national vaccination programme and when infections rocketed last year ihh provided laboratory testing services once some teething problems were sorted out the home recovery scheme also eased the strain on the healthcare system and is now the default for most patients with no or only mild symptoms in the book a social worker who gave her name as charlyn recounted some of the logistical acrobatics behind recovering at home throughout her 10 day isolation the 35 year old tried to stay in her bedroom as much as possible to not put her parents grandfather and domestic helper at risk she would step out to shower and then disinfect the ceiling walls and

        "content": "singapore as an active mobility enforcement officer ameo for 2 years ms sunarti abdul rahman has dealt with her fair share of errant cyclists and electric scooter riders who chafe at the idea of being booked but the 44 year old never imagined that she and her team would be threatened at knifepoint while conducting a routine enforcement operation in geylang last year she had stopped an elderly man who was riding an electric bicycle on a footpath this is not allowed under current rules and the device was overweight but this quickly turned into a stand off when the man who was unhappy that his e bike was going to be seized for investigation whipped out a penknife ms sunarti and her team were able to disarm him and call the police despite the harrowing experience ms sunarti who is employed by the land transport authority lta continued with the rest of her duties that day and remains undeterred in her mission to keep public paths safe thankfully most of the enforcement operations that she has participated in have been less eventful on thursday jan 13 the straits times was allowed to observe one such operation in yishun for about an hour in the late morning ms sunarti and 11 other enforcement officers were stationed at the junction of yishun ring road and yishun avenue 2 where they engaged cyclists food delivery riders and other active mobility device users in that time only one person was booked a woman who was riding a bicycle without handbrakes her bicycle was impounded and she surrendered it without fuss since september last year all bicycles used on public paths and roads must have at least one functioning handbrake after a fatal accident in 2020 sparked concerns over the use of brakeless bicycles more commonly known as fixies cyclists caught riding without handbrakes can be fined up to 10 000 jailed for up to six months or both for their first offence on thursday the enforcement officers also stopped e scooter and e bike riders to check if they had passed a mandatory theory test that was rolled out in july last year since the start of this year all e scooter and e bike riders must pass the test before they can use public paths a digital certificate with no expiry date is issued to those who pass as at jan 12 52 users have been caught riding without a mandatory theory test certificate the lta said those caught can be fined up to 2 000 and or jailed for six months for the first offence conflicts between ameos and errant riders were rife before the ban on e scooters from footpaths in november 2019 and the covid 19 pandemic led to a sharp drop in their number here as at the end of 2021 there were 6 388 registered e scooters down from the peak of about 100 000 in november 2019 meanwhile the number of e bikes here has continued to tick upwards there were 33 453 registered e bike at the end of 2021 slightly more than the 31 660 at the end of may last year said ms sunarti over the last few years i have seen more people cycling however as some are new to the use of active mobility devices they may not be familiar with the regulations and may risk the safety of themselves or others on the paths she said her approach when dealing with errant cyclists and riders is to be calm while also being firm when explaining the offences they have committed and the enforcement action that needs to be taken of course nobody likes to be booked especially if their devices are going to be taken away from them but when it starts to turn rowdy or they get aggressive my first priority is the safety of my officers and the people around them she added if there is tension she said she tries to understand the reasons behind it and see things from the cyclist's or rider's point of view she also ensures her body worn camera is switched on at all times in case of any dispute lta said it has been leveraging technology to expand its presence beyond the 200 or so enforcement officers that it deploys islandwide since 2019 it has been exploring the use of closed circuit cameras at hot spots where reckless riding and other active mobility offences are prevalent on the ground ameos are equipped with speed guns to catch those who exceed the 10kmh speed limit on footpaths and the 25kmh one on cycling paths and park connectors some of the common offences detected include the use of e scooters and e bikes on footpaths illegal modifications and the use of unregistered e scooters ms sunarti said her job involves more than just going after rule breakers we not only enforce but also educate path users on safety tips and regulations to foster a more responsible and gracious culture she told st she recounted that months after her encounter with the penknife wielding e bike rider she met him again while she was on patrol in the same area he recognised her and their second meeting was more cordial as she was able to ask how he was coping these opportunities to more deeply engage with active mobility users add value to her work she added to encourage more people here to use active mobility devices the government has committed to building around 1 300km of cycling paths by 2030 there are now about 500km of such paths across singapore and this will be extended to 800km in two to three years' time asked if she has any advice for cyclists and active mobility users ms sunarti said we have a shared responsibility because we are sharing the same public paths so it is good to understand the basic rules and regulations join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to

provide assistant at the point of time i was pillioned by my colleague on a 2b bike i told the rider to follow up and i contacted police immediately and told them i m following the car they asked me to stay safe and stay on the phone to update them the driver s current location the video only showed 5 of the story but it was a 15 minutes follow up from bedok to eunos still road to joo chiat to

        "content": "singapore while floods have ravaged malaysia major retailers and industry players in singapore said the overall supply of fish and vegetables here remains stable price increases of vegetables however were uneven the straits times visited four wet markets on wednesday dec 22 and found that not all types of vegetables increased in price and not all stalls raised prices for fish industry players whom st spoke to said they have observed price increases of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent the factors they cited for the rise however differ singapore fish merchants' general association said the rain causing floods in malaysia have deterred fishermen from going out to sea while punggol fish merchants association cited the usual year end monsoon season for the price hike mr ang jwee herng president of the singapore fish merchants' general association said the floods resulted in a decreased supply of 20 per cent to 30 per cent of fish from fishermen in malaysia which led to the increase in retail prices supply from fish farms such as seabass red snapper and golden pomfret are not affected he added referring to farms in both singapore and malaysia mr daniel pe who chairs the punggol fish merchants association said nowadays our sources are quite diverse our supply won't be affected by a single source there has been flooding in malaysia almost every year so this is expected severe flooding in malaysia over the weekend left 33 people dead as at wednesday dec 22 about 64 per cent of the 80 434 tonnes of leafy vegetables singapore imported last year came from malaysia some wet market stallholders however saw a drop in vegetable supplies but despite cost price rising they were hesitant to increase prices mr mic ng 42 who runs a vegetable stall at clementi 448 market and food centre said 80 per cent of his supplier's spring onions were destroyed in the flood pushing him to source from thailand instead while the cost price of spring onions did not increase for mr ng that of tomatoes from malaysia has more than doubled from 0 80 per kg to 1 95 this left him with no choice but to pass on the cost to his customers tomatoes are now sold at 2 50 per kg up from 1 50 per kg previously the cost price for 5kg of chilli padi also doubled from 20 to 40 and mr ng is now selling them at 10 per kg up from 7 before i can't increase the price too much if i did i wouldn't have customers so i'll settle for less profit margin he said at chong pang market and food centre vegetable stallholders also faced decreased supplies despite this madam aw beng choo 66 is not increasing prices now that business is so bad because of the pandemic how can we increase price no one will want to come she said a 48 year old stallholder at ghim moh road market and food centre who runs the business with her husband and wanted to be known only as ms zhang said her supplier has increased prices by about 30 per cent although half of the cherry tomatoes she ordered did not arrive due to the floods she maintained prices at 6 to 7 per kg so as to retain her regular customers cherry tomatoes are highly sought after around the christmas period i cannot increase the price she said but ms zhang raised prices for other vegetables such as japanese cucumber capsicum and romaine lettuce as the supplies for them have decreased slightly the price increase ranges between 1 and 2 she noted that prices and supplies have been fluctuating throughout the year there are even fewer customers this year compared with the festive period last year i'm exhausted from the ups and downs if there are lesser supplies we'll just sell less she added a vegetable stallholder at nee soon east n2 market who wanted to be known only as mr jeya 32 said his supplier also increased prices by 20 per cent to 30 per cent we absorbed some of the costs and raised retail prices by 10 per cent he said we are affected by the holiday season not the malaysia floods because kids are free during the holidays and families cook less and they go out to eat meanwhile other stallholders currently unaffected by floods in malaysia are bracing themselves for the impact mr tay zhong wei 34 who runs a vegetable stall at clementi 448 market and food centre said his supplies for the week have not been affected but he will increase prices next week if there is a shortage mr jerry tan vice secretary of the singapore fruits and vegetables importers and exporters association did not observe supply disruption as their members source for vegetables from johor and cameron highlands in malaysia he explained floods didn't affect our supply as those areas don't supply to us supermarkets such as fairprice and sheng siong said they have not experienced a supply disruption to vegetables eggs fish and poultry a fairprice spokesman said prices of food imports from malaysia have remained stable we will continue to monitor the situation closely and ensure that our customers have a stable supply of

agri tech and waste management industries is expected to add 55 000 new and upgraded jobs in the next decade but citing a recent survey done by hsbc bank ms nadia said the lack of qualified staff could reduce the amount of funds that investors concerned over environmental social and governance esg issues pour into asia esg refers to investments that consider environmental social and governance principles the survey had found that 40 per cent of investors in asia have a firm wide policy on sustainable investing in esg areas but 40 per cent in asia is lower compared with 91 per cent in europe and 72 per cent in the united states the survey found what we really want to ensure here is that singaporeans of all backgrounds can be front and centre to participate and take advantage of these opportunities in the green sector added ms nadia the gpc is also concerned about how local businesses of all sizes can survive and thrive as sustainability concerns become more integrated into the global market mr wee said local corporations and small and medium sized enterprises smes have told him that they wish to adopt more sustainable practices but many of them do not know how to go about it and are concerned with costs to address that mr wee and other mps will speak on the need to provide more guidance for companies to reduce their carbon emissions they will propose that the government publish a catalogue of firms with low or reduced carbon emissions so that other companies are incentivised to follow best practices the mps speaking on the motion will draw on a paper by the youth wing of the pap young pap that had focused on developing a green economic ecosystem which proposed changes to singapore's carbon tax policy among other areas singapore's carbon tax which is currently at 5 per tonne of emissions until 2023 has been pegged as being too low by climate change observers the revised rate for 2024 and beyond will be announced during next month's budget the mps said they will suggest a tiered carbon tax rate so that larger emitters pay more than middle tier emitters to incentivise firms to reduce their carbon footprint mr wee said as sustainability standards become essential in the global marketplace we need to help our businesses get ahead of the curve when the firms have more opportunities i'm sure singaporeans will also have better jobs and higher income a skillsfuture report released in december 2021 estimated that there are more than 450 job roles across 17 sectors in the green economy with opportunities for urban farmers energy traders environment health and safety managers sustainability managers and solar project engineers ms poh noted that to prepare the economy for the additional thousands of jobs the education system needs to get ready she said the speeches on the motion next week will cover the need to have more internship opportunities for students and have educators optimise course materials for their students beyond green jobs as singapore develops into a sustainability related finance and accounting hub more roles will be created for accountants and auditors in this space added mr wee a carbon tax provides the price signal to encourage companies to reduce their emissions singapore's carbon tax currently applies to all facilities producing 25 000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year covering 30 to 40 large emitters that contribute 80 per cent of singapore's greenhouse gas emissions the current rate which is 5 per tonne of emissions has been pegged as being too low by climate change observers the international monetary fund imf has recommended that by 2030 various economies should each implement a carbon price floor based on a tiered system to reduce emissions enough to keep global warming below 2 deg c the threshold to avoid catastrophic climate change outlined in the paris agreement the world's climate pact based on the imf's recommendation the 2030 price floor should be us 75 s 100 per tonne of emissions for advanced economies us 50 for high income emerging market economies such as china and us 25 for lower income emerging markets such as india singapore has ambitions to become a leading green financial hub the instruments driving a green economy include the trade in carbon credits carbon credits represent one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that is either avoided renewable energy plant or removed from the atmosphere forest conservation projects buying a carbon credit essentially entails paying someone else such as a company embarking on a forest conservation project elsewhere to reduce one tonne of planet warming emissions on the buyer's behalf nominated mp and conservation scientist koh lian pin who helms the centre for nature based climate solutions at the national university of singapore said that during the parliamentary discussion he will raise the importance of how the use of high quality carbon offsets can be part of singapore's low carbon transition i will also mention that it is important to address issues around the lack of transparency in the global carbon marketplace to ensure that carbon offsetting actually delivers the

        "content": "singapore the rare cinereous vulture the first of the species recorded in singapore tested its wings for the first time on wednesday afternoon jan 5 since hospitalisation the clear sunny skies and winds made it optimal for the raptor to rise with the national parks board nparks and mandai wildlife group jointly deciding to free the bird two hours before the time of the planned flight test to ensure the best weather conditions but the juvenile which weighs about 7kg barely flew more than 50m before landing in an adjacent field following its short flight the vulture was examined by veterinarians from jurong bird park before it was allowed to try again but it merely wandered for an hour weather conditions worsened and the bird was taken away by nparks and mandai wildlife group staff to rest for the day wednesday's flight was a marked improvement from the day before when the vulture remained grounded during its first release attempt in a joint response to the straits times nparks and mandai wildlife group said the bird s flight of more than 50m was promising because it has not been observed to have flown since it was rescued meanwhile the bird has been eating well and is in healthy condition the organisations added that they will find another opportune time to release the bird when conditions are suitable so that the bird can resume its migratory movement pattern in a statement to the straits times on monday night dr xie shangzhe deputy vice president for conservation research and veterinary at mandai wildlife group said that the migratory bird had been well enough for release he said it is necessary to make sure that these animals achieve good return to function to ensure their survival back in the wild for migratory species there is a fine line between releasing them too early such that they have not built up enough energy reserves and releasing too late resulting in a disruption of their migratory movement patterns the cinereous vulture was first sighted at the singapore botanic gardens a week ago last thursday it was photographed by flocks of bird enthusiasts along with five himalayan griffon vultures at the gardens it was later found sitting weakly on the ground at cornwall gardens in farrer road by a bird photographer who wanted to be known as martin t nparks group director of wildlife management adrian loo told st on tuesday that the cinereous vulture had taken off with other birds at singapore botanic gardens in the late morning but was too weak to sustain flight and landed dr xie said on monday that the scavenger's weakened state was probably due to exhaustion from flying long distances a common challenge faced by migratory birds and needed to replenish its energy reserves the bird was later taken to jurong bird park's bird hospital for veterinary care until monday no obvious abnormalities or injuries were detected when the scavenger was first checked by jurong bird park's avian veterinarian team said dr xie the sooty species native to europe and northern asia is vagrant to south east asia said dr loo this means the bird has flown off course or was blown off course it usually spends winters in northern india the middle east and occasionally south korea he added during the yearly migratory bird season thousands of migratory birds fly in from their breeding grounds in the northern hemisphere to singapore to feed and roost said dr loo this occurs between september and march and the nation's mangroves mudflats ponds and forests become homes for these birds singapore is an important stopover for migratory birds said dr loo as it is part of the east asian australasian flyway a migratory route that stretches from the arctic through russia and alaska to australia and new zealand encompassing 22 countries and the central asian flyway which includes the himalayas where the cinereous vulture can be found wherever possible migratory birds taken to jurong bird park's bird hospital will be released back to their natural habitats usually within a day if they are healthy said dr xie there are rare instances however where a bird may be absorbed into mandai wildlife group's parks if they require long term care and monitoring he added in 2005 a himalayan griffon vulture was rescued at nanyang girls' high school after it was seen vomiting the scavenger named genghis remains under the care of the park's animal presentation team after it was treated and rehabilitated members of the public should contact nparks or the animal concerns research and education society acres when they

strong enough to do so the migratory bird singapore's first record of the largest raptor in europe asia and africa had been hospitalised at jurong bird park's bird hospital since last thursday the hefty bird remained grounded on tuesday morning despite encouragement from national parks board nparks and mandai wildlife group staff after about 30 minutes the vulture was taken away for further recuperation deputy vice president for conservation research and veterinary of mandai wildlife group xie shangzhe told the straits times that the vulture did not take flight mainly due to the weather condition which had initially looked promising ahead of the release he said larger birds rely on thermal uplifts for flight which are created when the sun warms the ground on cooler cloudy days like today such thermal uplifts are lessened earlier dr xie said no abnormalities or injuries were detected when the scavenger was first checked by jurong bird park's avian veterinarian team they had conducted full body x rays a blood cell count and organ function tests dr xie said the scavenger was most likely exhausted a common challenge for migratory birds from flying long distances and needed to replenish its energy reserves thousands of birds like the vulture migrate to warmer regions to avoid cold winters in parts of the world during the yearly migratory season which takes place between september and march nparks' group director of wildlife management adrian loo said singapore is an important stopover for these birds as it is part of the east asian australasian flyway a migratory

species said dr xie when the vulture first arrived at the bird hospital last thursday the raptor was lying on its side weakly and was given fluid therapy he said by the next day the vulture could stand well on its own and was fed boneless meat once the bird had enough energy and could use its legs to break down large pieces of bone it was fed up to about 600g of red meat with bone a day migratory birds are not common at singapore's bird hospital noted dr xie adding that majority of these creatures are treated for exhaustion or traumatic injuries from predator wounds or vehicle collisions wherever possible they will be released back to their natural habitats usually within a day if they are healthy he added there are rare instances however where a bird may be absorbed into

last thursday are also advised by nparks to be socially responsible and observe safe management measures while tiredness and hunger is commonly observed exhaustion and starvation tends to plague larger flocks said dr xie the larger the group of migratory flock the greater the competition among them for similar resources he said all birds can potentially crash into obstacles such as tall buildings but as migratory birds tend to fly in larger flocks this may be more problematic as it affects a larger number of birds when it happens said dr xie other animals may attack the migratory birds which may not be as familiar with this threat and therefore be at greater risk of being eaten said dr xie the increased unpredictability of the weather and frequency of inclement weather results in unfamiliar patterns in the flight paths of migratory birds said dr xie this may result in them needing to fly longer distances leading to exhaustion changes in weather patterns also affect the patterns of disease distribution which may result in migratory birds being exposed to diseases that can impact their health contact nparks or the animal concerns research and education society acres

said on wednesday dec 1 among singapore residents aged 65 and over the employment rate rose to 31 7 per cent in june this year up from 28 5 per cent a year ago mom's advance annual labour market report showed the employment rate of seniors this year surpassed the pre covid 19 rate of 27 6 per cent in 2019 the news comes after it was announced on nov 1 that the retirement age for singapore workers will be progressively raised to 65 years old under the law with the re employment age going up to 70 to support older singaporeans who wish to continue working to do so the increased employment is supported by sustained efforts to raise the employability of seniors such as the senior worker early adopter grant which provides funding support of up to 125 000 to progressive employers who are willing and able to implement higher internal retirement and re employment ages above the prevailing statutory ages employment rates rose across different demographic groups reflecting economic recovery and measures supporting employment said mom the employment rate of youth aged 15 to 24 rose from 30 9 per cent in june last year to 37 2 per cent in june this year due to more students taking on part time or temporary work on the side for residents aged 25 to 64 the employment rate rose from 80 3 per cent in june last year to 81 8 per cent in june this year the improvement was across both genders from 87 9 per cent to 88 9 per cent for men and from 73 2 per cent to 75 1 per cent for women the number of residents on permanent employment also grew by 50 900 with 88 per cent of resident employees being permanently employed the proportion of employees on fixed term contracts stood at 8 4 per cent an increase from the 7 3 per cent in june last year this was due to the increased demand for temporary manpower for covid 19 related activities and economic uncertainty the increase was also driven by the rise in residents on contracts of less than one year the resident long term unemployment rates held steady at 0 8 per cent for professional managerial executive and technical jobs pmets and dipped to 0 9 per cent for non pmets after increasing last year the non seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for resident non pmets improved from 6 4 per cent in june last year to 5 1 per cent in june this year the unemployment rate for resident pmets also edged down from 3 5 per cent to 3 4 per cent however the rates have yet to return to pre covid 19 rates the elevated long term unemployment rate compared with pre covid 19 suggests that some workers who were displaced earlier faced challenges in their job search said mom meanwhile the resident time related under employment rate eased from 4 1 per cent in june last year to 3 5 per cent in june this year though it remains above pre covid 19 rates most groups experienced improvements including the lower educated and older workers who were more affected last year the suspension of dine in services and in person tuition and enrichment classes during the heightened alert period led to time related under employment rates in june this year being the highest in the food and beverage services and education the rates were also higher than pre covid 19 levels minister for manpower tan see leng said he was very encouraged to see the increased employment of seniors with the progressive increase of retirement and re employment ages starting from 2022 we want to give senior workers the flexibility to stay employed should they choose to dr tan told reporters after visiting staff at raffles hotel on wednesday these have to be complemented by efforts to make workplaces more age friendly such as by redesigning jobs providing more part time re employment opportunities and helping senior workers upskill and reskill to support businesses he added mr sulaiman eman 59 one of the 75 senior workers above 50 years old employed at raffles hotel singapore has been a senior butler at the hotel for almost three years he was trained under workforce singapore's career conversion programme for hotel professionals to learn skills such as setting up tables and how to serve and present dishes

estimates released by the ministry of manpower mom the median income of residents singaporeans and permanent residents rose above pre covid 19 levels this year rebounding from last year when it took a hit for the first time in 16 years because of the pandemic the overall employment rate of residents aged 15 and above also grew to 67 2 per cent in june up from 64 5 per cent a year earlier the ministry said in its annual report on wednesday dec 1 this is also higher than the 65 2 per cent in june 2019 a further breakdown showed that the improvement was broad based across various groups owing to the economic recovery and support measures such as the sgunited jobs and skills package and jobs growth incentive jgi mom highlighted in its report which is based on mid year data the employment rate of youth aged 15 to 24 jumped to 37 2 per cent in june from 30 9 per cent a year ago this was mainly due to more students taking on part time or temporary work on the side said the ministry for residents aged 25 to 64 this rate grew to 81 8 per cent in june from 80 3 per cent the year before at the same time the rate for seniors aged 65 and above rose to 31 7 per cent up from 28 5 last year on wednesday manpower minister tan see leng said while we see improvements being made in strides we have to bear in mind that we are not fully back to pre covid 19 levels and we are not completely out of the woods especially when there's so much news of world governments healthcare systems grappling with the new omicron variant his ministry said it expects the labour market recovery to continue into 2022 but in an uneven manner across sectors unemployment figures for instance have remained elevated this is despite the rates improving over the year the resident unemployment rate for professionals managers executives and technicians pmets edged down slightly to 3 4 per cent in june from 3 5 per cent a year earlier for resident non pmets the rate fell to 5 1 per cent from 6 4 per cent the resident long term unemployment rates which look at those who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more held steady at 0 8 per cent for pmets and 0 9 per cent for non pmets after increasing last year mom said this elevated long term unemployment rate compared with before the pandemic suggests that some displaced workers faced challenges in their job hunt maybank kim eng economist chua hak bin attributed this to the uneven labour market recovery displaced workers from distressed sectors such as hospitality and retail may face difficulties in securing jobs in the fast growing sectors like finance and tech because of skills mismatches he added in the latest monthly update on unemployment given by mom on wednesday the overall rate remained unchanged in october at 2 6 per cent the resident unemployment rate fell to 3 4 per cent in october from 3 5 per cent in september the rate for citizens also fell slightly from 3 7 per cent to 3 6 per cent despite this 88 per cent of resident employees were in permanent roles said the mom report it added that the number of residents on permanent employment grew by 50 900 an increase in demand for temporary labour for covid 19 related activities and economic uncertainty led to a new high in the share of those on fixed term contracts at 8 4 per cent this was an increase from 7 3 per cent last year and was driven by more residents taking on contracts of less than one year as at end september more than 146 000 job seekers have been placed into jobs attachment and training opportunities under the sgunited jobs and skills package said mom the jgi which supports firms to expand hiring of local job seekers helped 58 000 businesses hire more than 400 000 locals between september last year and may this year in its report the ministry also highlighted how full timers put in fewer hours of work per week compared with a decade ago full time employed residents worked an average of 45 hours a week this year compared with 49 2 hours a week in 2010 meanwhile the nominal median income of residents singaporeans and permanent residents grew by 3 2 per cent to 4 680 in june from 4 534 in june last year this was after it dipped by 0 6 per cent last year after taking inflation into account the growth in real median income was smaller at 1 1 per cent a reversal from the 0 4 per cent decline the previous year mom said the income data is for people in full time employment and includes employer central provident fund contributions those earning less saw their incomes recovering to levels before the pandemic hit real income of full timers at the 20th percentile rose by 4 6 per cent not including government payouts mom said that if government payouts to lower income workers are considered such as the workfare income supplement the income at the 20th percentile this year surpassed its pre covid 19 level by 0 6 per cent per annum over the five years from 2016 to this year the real income growth of lower wage workers remained strong enabling them to continue to gain ground on median incomes the ministry said bolstered by efforts such as the progressive wage model to improve their salaries the real income growth of full timers at the 20th percentile was 2 8 per cent per year higher than the median of 2 2 per cent per year dr tan speaking to the media after visiting staff at raffles hotel on wednesday said his ministry will focus its efforts on supporting employers in adapting their businesses and preparing workers for future jobs we also have to take a longer term view to look at how industries and job roles will pivot and transform national trades union congress assistant secretary general desmond choo on wednesday said there is a need to consistently review structural issues within the job

three to five years of 56 positions studied in the jobs transformation map jtm for the sector about 54 per cent of job roles which 36 000 workers account for will experience at least a medium degree of change which will require job redesign or undergo displacement overall all job roles are expected to experience some level of change new roles such as in data analysis and software development are beginning to emerge and this trend is expected to accelerate these findings from the jtm for the logistics sector were outlined in the 28th jobs situation report released on friday nov 26 manpower minister tan see leng said the changes to job roles in the logistics sector should make the work more fulfilling and the emerging positions offer bright prospects he was speaking to the media on friday at a virtual press conference after a visit to st logistics' facility in clementi loop dr tan said i encourage employers to redesign jobs to increase the attractiveness and appeal of their roles to new and existing talents this will also help to raise productivity and enable workers to deliver greater value for the business with more value added tasks more than 86 000 workers are employed in the logistics sector here based on 2019 data the jtm for the logistics sector is championed by the economic development board and supported by the ministry of manpower mom enterprise singapore skillsfuture singapore and workforce singapore the map was launched in june last year similar maps have been launched for the wholesale trade human resources and financial services sectors eleven more jtms are being developed to cover other sectors such as food manufacturing and construction to help guide businesses and workers in transformation efforts to seize new opportunities in their respective sectors in the joint release on friday mom and the four agencies highlighted several findings on the changes in job roles some positions like warehouse assistants may be disrupted as transactional tasks which are manual labour intensive and repetitive become automated workers in such jobs will need to reskill to take on redesigned roles or be redeployed to new ones other positions such as freight inspectors inventory management managers and transport executives will also see their scope augmented by technology to boost efficiency the report noted that workers above the age of 40 make up a significant proportion 63 1 per cent of local staff in the logistics sector with the experience and expertise built up over the years employers can continue to tap this talent pool through upskilling and reskilling training should not however be limited to just older workers but also be extended to younger staff whose responsibilities are constantly shifting with the adoption of new technologies firms can consider introducing in house initiatives to build relevant skills or using wsg's career conversion programmes ccps or the infocomm media development authority's tech immersion and placement programme the report said close to 650 workers from 226 companies have tapped ccps relevant to the logistics sector as at september this year st logistics is among firms which have automated processes and embraced ccps to fulfil new roles over the past two years the logistics company works with public sector and commercial customers in the region through the ccps st logistics employees learnt how to use new technologies to leverage data insights and reduce labour intensive work improving efficiency and output mr loganathan ramasamy chief executive of st logistics said while we put in money to upgrade our facilities and bring in autonomous systems it's equally or more important to make sure that our workforce is ready to use these technologies to enhance productivity it is important to help staff build confidence in using these systems and make them feel like they are part of the company's transformation he added mr mohammad zailan bujang 51 a senior logistics coordinator at st logistics was previously a senior logistics assistant whose responsibilities included manual picking and packing of orders after the firm implemented new technology in the warehouse he was trained to operate automated systems and has also been taught how to do basic maintenance and generation of reports while he was initially daunted by the task given that he was not computer savvy mr zailan was also excited about the challenge and wanted to be able to keep up with the times in the end it was not as difficult as i thought and i am amazed at how much productivity

        "content": "singapore the tightened measures for future housing board flats in prime locations such as a longer 10 year minimum occupation period mop should help temper demand and dampen resale price increases in future said national development minister desmond lee he was addressing concerns that first time sellers of these prime flats could bump up the price of their units to account for the subsidies that hdb will claw back at the point of sale the recovery of additional subsidies that will be pumped in to keep new build to order bto flats in prime areas affordable is another feature of the new prime location public housing plh model announced on wednesday oct 27 all subsidies will be factored into prices when the units are launched as bto flats mr lee said it is hard to predict how exactly prices will evolve he said it depends on so many factors and considerations market considerations buyers' sentiments and so on speaking at the singapore economic policy forum 2021 on friday oct 29 he said the government has received diverse feedback from all quarters since the new model was revealed one of the deepest points of contention was on the additional eligibility conditions for resale buyers of plh flats said mr lee the conditions include a 14 000 income ceiling similar to that for bto applicants some have asked why the rules include an income ceiling given the government's aim to keep prime locations inclusive acknowledging this apparent paradox mr lee said it is not our intention to exclude anyone from these prime locations if land and resources were not the constraint one would seek to provide for all but without some intervention mr lee said resale prices would likely rise out of reach of many singaporeans thus excluding them from these prime location flats calibrated restrictions are thus needed to keep such flats accessible to a wider group he added he said there are existing hdb resale flats and private housing in prime central areas for those who do not meet the plh eligibility conditions which are similar to existing criteria for buying bto flats this is an objective set of means tested conditions that singaporeans are already familiar with mr lee said the 14 000 income ceiling covers more than eight in 10 households he noted that the income ceiling does not keep out those who have low income but high wealth such as children of well to do parents or wealthy retirees we considered this too but it's not straightforward to comprehensively means test one's wealth or one's family's wealth said mr lee who added that the bto criteria serve as some form of proxy for wealth for instance private property owners are not allowed to buy a plh flat until 30 months after selling their private property he said but it's hard to do much more in a meaningful way we remain always open to suggestions and we will keep studying the issue on concerns from some people that the 10 year mop up from five for typical hdb flats is too long and not practical because family and life circumstances may change during that period mr lee noted that there were others who felt 10 years was too short on balance we thought that the longer mop was indeed warranted to emphasise owner occupation and reduce speculative demand which would be greater for flats in such good locations he said adding that hdb data indicates that most people live in their flats for more than 10 years before selling them there is no magic number that works for all families in all situations said mr lee he added that those who face extenuating circumstances during their mop will have their appeals considered on a case by case basis in a manner similar to those currently on five year mops mr lee also addressed feedback that allowing plh flat owners to only rent out rooms and not the whole flat diminishes their property rights while he said he understood such opinions others who faced difficulties in getting flats have voiced frustration when they see hdb flats for rent as they feel that subsidised housing should not be a source of income to strike a balance mr lee said plh flats which will likely fetch higher rents should be prioritised even more for those buying a long term home to reduce speculative demand and moderate resale prices we may not be able to screen out speculative demand completely but the 10 year mop and disallowing whole flat rental will go a long way he said firm action will be taken against people who abuse the rules by renting out their entire flat while locking up one room and pretending to still live in it he added some have done so with existing flats renting out the entire unit before their mops have expired flats have been taken back from owners in egregious cases and the authorities will see how best to enforce regulations especially for prime location flats where the temptation to game the system may be higher he said join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news

development minister desmond lee on tuesday oct 26 the first build to order bto project under this model will be located in rochor and launched next month the pool of resale buyers of these prime hdb flats will also be limited to households who earn not more than 14 000 a month and at least one applicant must be a singapore citizen under the plh model fewer flats may be set aside under hdb's married child priority scheme which gives priority to applicants whose parents or children live in the same area currently up to 30 per cent of new flats are set aside under this scheme for families buying a flat for the first time at a media briefing on tuesday mr lee said the new model is to keep public housing in prime locations affordable accessible and inclusive for singaporeans both at the initial purchase and at subsequent resales on the open market the plh model will apply only to future public housing in prime locations and not to existing flat owners there will be at least one prime location public housing project launched each year but the exact proportions will differ year on year as it depends on site availability and the overall supply of flats across all towns said mr lee in order for hdb to launch these prime flats at affordable prices at the bto stage it has to provide additional subsidies on top of the those provided for all bto flats said mr lee all subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as bto flats but the concern is whether this would lead to the lottery effect excessive windfall gains and whether it would be fair to bto buyers in other parts of singapore who would not get these additional subsidies he said a record number of hdb flats have changed hands for at least 1 million this year in the first nine months of this year there were 174 million dollar hdb flats compared with 82 for the whole of last year which raised eyebrows and set off concerns about home affordability they came on the back of a buoyant hdb resale market in which resale flat prices also hit a record high in the third quarter of this year to address these concerns the government will claw back additional subsidies provided to plh flats flat owners will pay a percentage of the resale price to hdb when they resell their home on the open market for the first time he said this will apply only to those who bought the flat from hdb and not to subsequent resale transactions the exact percentage will be announced at the launch of the rochor bto project next month which is the first site under the plh model and may be adjusted for other projects in the future he said other prime locations for public housing include the future greater southern waterfront however buyers who want one of these flats on the resale market will have to meet the prevailing eligibility conditions for buying a flat directly from the hdb these include having at least one applicant who is a singapore citizen meeting the household income ceiling of 14 000 and not holding a private property or sold any in the last 30 months singles above 35 years old will not be allowed to buy these plh flats this is in contrast to current rules that do not place limitations on singles above the age of 35 buying resale flats without such restrictions the resale prices of these homes in prime locations may rise beyond the reach of many singaporeans over time said mr lee these conditions on the resale pool will also act as safeguards to prevent sellers from adding the subsidy recovery to their asking price in the hopes of trying to maximise gains he added buyers will be a circumscribed group of people who meet bto eligibility requirements so that means not anyone can buy and buyers will also have to bear in mind the impositions on subsequent resale on him or her he said so that will ensure that the moderated market for the prime location public housing flats is functional to ensure buyers are genuinely buying the flat to live in instead of hoping to flip it for a windfall the mop for prime location hdb flats will be extended to 10 years up from the current five owners will also not be allowed to rent out their whole flat at any point in time even after the mop is over these conditions will apply to all flat owners who purchase bto and resale flats under the plh model the resale restrictions will be in place for at least half of the 99 year lease of each prime location hdb flat before the government considers whether to review them mr lee said these policies will help to strengthen the owner occupation intent of public housing and also seek to deter speculative demand and moderate resale prices he added however hdb housing grants will still be available for eligible buyers and the prevailing ethnic quota under hdb's ethnic integration policy will apply when asked what constitutes a prime location mr lee said it refers to the city centre in central singapore and the future greater southern waterfront some of the hdb towns and estates immediately surrounding the city centre may qualify depending on the attributes of the sites within those areas he said i think let's keep it tight for now to these central prime locations because there are constraints on the buyers of these homes and we have a clear social objective to achieve by injecting these flats in areas which under today's context would normally be for private housing public rental flats will also be included at these sites where feasible said mr lee he added that the new plh model which comes after almost a year of public consultations strives to balance the many considerations and trade offs while fulfilling the key social objectives of public housing as with all our policies the new plh model is not cast in stone it is very new and we will continue to review the parameters over time based on our experience from the projects that are launched along the way he said join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered

        "content": "singapore a new mechanism will soon be in place to facilitate transfers of official foreign reserves to the government for longer term investment by sovereign wealth fund gic this comes after parliament passed changes to the monetary authority of singapore mas act on tuesday jan 11 to allow the central bank to subscribe for a new type of non marketable security reserves management government securities rmgs which will facilitate the transfer of official foreign reserves at present transfers of mas' official foreign reserves are facilitated by a reduction in the government's singapore dollar cash deposits with mas as consideration however this transfer mechanism is increasingly facing constraints and mainly because mas' accumulation of official foreign reserves has persistently outpaced the growth of government deposits in recent years we hence need a new instrument to effect the transfer of assets from mas to the government for long term investment management said finance minister lawrence wong on tuesday he outlined that safeguards will be added to avoid any misperception that rmgs will constitute monetary financing of government spending this is because mas will be empowered to subscribe for rmgs for the sole purpose of facilitating the transfer of official foreign reserves to the government and can do so only if the subscription does not compromise its objective of ensuring medium term price stability at the same time the amendments require mas to use only foreign assets to subscribe for rmgs and correspondingly the government to accept only foreign assets in exchange to be accounted for in the government securities fund this eliminates the possibility of mas as a central bank creating singdollars to finance government spending said mr wong who is also deputy chairman of mas during the debate on the bill several mps including mr liang eng hwa bukit panjang asked about mas' management of official foreign reserves and how the optimal amount of official foreign reserves is determined in 2019 mas assessed that it should maintain official foreign reserves at around 65 per cent to 75 per cent of gross domestic product on an ongoing basis this would provide a buffer against stresses in the global economy and markets and underpin confidence in singapore's exchange rate centred monetary policy and the domestic financial system mr wong noted that mas takes reference from historical episodes of significant domestic and international disruptions to compute the official foreign reserves necessary to safeguard stability and confidence he highlighted that transferring excess official foreign reserves to gic for long term management is not a new idea but rather a longstanding practice refuting non constituency mp leong mun wai's suggestion that the new mechanism would be a departure from singapore s reserves management principles transferring excess official foreign reserves to gic for long term management was the very reason why gic was set up in 1981 mr wong pointed out addressing a question on whether the mas deliberately keeps singapore's exchange rate low for competitive reasons the minister stressed that this is not the central bank's policy mas' aim is price stability over the medium term we are quite clear that keeping the singdollar artificially weak is unsustainable and not in singapore's interest he said mps such as mr louis ng nee soon grc also raised questions about the rmgs issuance limit which is set at 580 billion this limit has been set so that the government can administer and monitor rmgs issuance and having such a limit will provide transparency to parliament which serves as an additional layer of checks mr wong said should the need arise the government will have to go back to parliament and justify any further increase to the rmgs issuance limit he also noted that this transfer of official foreign reserves not needed by mas should have a slight positive impact on the net investment returns contribution over the long term this is to be expected because gic has a higher return seeking portfolio than mas mr wong said acknowledging that in the short term this increase is not expected to be significant in reply to mr leong's question about disclosing the size of singapore's national reserves the minister reiterated that it is not in singapore's interest to put out the full information on how much reserves it has the reserves are ultimately a strategic asset against a whole range of emergency contingency scenarios he added we believe that it is still in our national interest to maintain this strategic asset to have some discretion on our part and to be able to use these resources decisively and effectively when such an

        "content": "singapore the impact of the goods and services tax gst hike will be delayed for the majority of households in singapore and the date the rise takes place is not when singaporeans will feel its impact second minister for finance indranee rajah told parliament on tuesday jan 11 amid global inflationary pressures the government has been shielding singaporeans from the full impact of rising prices and will continue to do so she added and as it prepares for the upcoming budget priority will be given to helping singaporeans cope with the cost of living the scope of household support measures is also being reviewed she said the minister was responding to questions from several mps on rising costs and the impending gst hike of 2 percentage points from 7 per cent to 9 per cent rising inflation around the world has pushed up the cost of groceries and utilities bills and mr liang eng hwa bukit panjang asked if the expected gst hike can be delayed in the light of inflation ms indranee said the increase in gst is not something that can be put off forever first announced in 2018 the rise is meant to help singapore meet rising recurrent spending needs especially in healthcare and social support in deciding the timing for the gst hike we are carefully considering the overall economic conditions the economy is recovering steadily and barring fresh disruptions it should grow in step with global economic recovery said the minister adding that gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3 per cent to 5 per cent this year but ms indranee pointed out that the date the gst hike takes effect is not the same as the date that the impact of the hike will be felt irrespective of when the gst goes up the government will be able to delay its impact on singaporeans through the assurance package she added the 6 billion assurance package which has already been set aside will stave off the impact of the hike by five years for the majority of singaporeans and by 10 years for the lower income groups said ms indranee essentially whatever the increase to their expenditure as a result of gst the assurance package is designed to buffer them for that increase the government is directly supplementing them so that they won't feel the impact she added the government will continue to look out for low income households and the majority of middle income households she said ms indranee said the gst and the income and wealth taxes are important revenue sources for the government which will ensure the overall system of taxes and transfers remains fair and progressive we need sound fiscal foundations not just to provide support to households and businesses when needed but also to meet our collective aspirations affordable healthcare quality education and a safe and secure home in a responsible and sustainable way she added on the impact of inflation on costs of living ms indranee said the government understands the concerns of singaporeans about these cost increases and empathises with the very real pressures felt by individuals and households and has been working hard to help people cope in a number of ways she noted that the two key drivers of core inflation are higher global fuel costs and food prices leading to higher prices for utilities and groceries the majority of singaporeans have been directly shielded from the full impact of this through various schemes such as the gst voucher u save rebates which help with the cost of utilities for those living in housing board flats as well as community development council vouchers which defray food costs and public transport vouchers which help those in lower income groups cope with fare adjustments ms indranee also said that while the inflation rate of 3 8 per cent reported in november is high a significant part of it is accounted for by accommodation and private transport costs but since most singaporeans live in owner occupied homes and use public transport the monetary authority of singapore's core inflation measure of 1 6 per cent which excludes accommodation and private transport would more accurately reflect the actual inflation experienced by most of them she explained she noted that a significant share of the recent rise in prices is driven by global factors higher energy prices have had an impact on utilities bills while global food prices and supply chain disruptions have affected prices of non cooked food locally ms indranee said the sharp rise in global energy and food prices is expected to be temporary and should subside as bottlenecks are resolved and supply improves to better meet demand she also said the government will continue to monitor economic conditions closely to ensure that businesses are adequately supported especially in the more adversely affected sectors and to balance tapering off of relief with support for transformation and restructuring join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered

        "content": "singapore singapore does not expect persistent accelerating inflation ahead and cost pressures are expected to ease gradually over the course of the year said minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling in parliament on tuesday jan 11 addressing several mps' questions on inflation concerns and the impact on singapore's economy and consumers she said that the ministry of trade and industry mti and the monetary authority of singapore mas expect inflationary pressures arising from external factors to be temporary singapore's headline inflation rose to 3 8 per cent in november last year while core inflation which she said was a more useful gauge of rising prices as it excludes accommodation and private road transport costs came in at 1 6 per cent the same month several global factors such as energy prices food supply constraints and supply bottlenecks in transport hubs are behind the rise of inflation ms low said noting how other countries and regions such as the united states the euro zone and south korea are also grappling with inflation she said that in the near term singapore is likely to continue facing external cost pressures due to factors such as elevated global energy prices and bottlenecks in global transportation besides external cost pressures singapore's domestic wage growth is likely to continue to improve as labour demand strengthens on the back of improving economic activity ms low said at the same time as the covid 19 situation stabilises consumer demand should improve she added with these factors in mind singapore's core inflation is expected to increase in the first half of 2022 before easing in the latter part of the year ms low said adding that it could average within the upper half of the official forecast range of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for the full year headline inflation is projected to average 1 5 per cent to 2 5 per cent this year following the expected 2 3 per cent in 2021 mti and mas will carefully monitor price trends over the next few months of the year closely before revising the forecasts if necessary ms low said while the small and open nature of singapore's economy constrains how much the government can shield singaporeans from inflationary pressures it is sparing no effort to lessen its impact she added to this end the government has a multi pronged strategy to mitigate inflationary pressures she said first it strives to keep the singapore economy competitive so that it can continue to create good jobs to bring sustainable wage growth for singaporeans she noted that singapore's strong economic recovery in 2021 helped to ensure that resident workers saw real wage growth in 2021 after accounting for inflation real median income growth of full time employed residents in 2021 was positive at 1 1 per cent real income also rose by 4 6 per cent for lower income residents at the bottom 20th percentile ms low cited second the mas tightened monetary policy last october in light of imported and domestic cost pressures since then the singapore dollar has strengthened which will help reduce the singapore dollar cost of imports and shield singaporeans from some of the external cost pressures for instance the singapore dollar has appreciated significantly against the currencies of the country's major food sources over the longer term and this has moderated the pass through effects of external inflationary pressure ms low said third the government carefully manages domestic supply side constraints such as the supply of industrial and commercial space to help rein in business rental costs that may translate to higher consumer prices policy measures such as the jobs support scheme have also alleviated labour costs she added fourth singapore's diversification of food import sources helps to ensure that prices of food supplies remain competitive and reduces its vulnerability to large price fluctuations globally ms low pointed out the republic's domestic non cooked food prices saw a relatively smaller increase of 1 6 per cent year on year between july and november 2021 compared with the 30 per cent year on year rise in global food commodity prices over the same period fifth the authorities work closely with industry partners to ensure that the prices of daily necessities and food items are competitive and affordable ms low cited how some businesses are going out of their way to help consumers such as by providing an allocated amount of food for the likes of low income families the unemployed and the elderly to redeem sixth targeted assistance is provided to lower income singaporeans who need support for basic living expenses through schemes such as the permanent gst goods and services tax voucher scheme addressing questions from mr ang wei neng west coast grc and ms jessica tan east coast grc on how the government is helping businesses manage cost increases which could in turn be passed on to consumers ms low noted that government agencies are working with companies to help them better cope with supply chain disruptions and firms can tap schemes under enterprise singapore such as the enterprise financing scheme which helps small and medium sized enterprises obtain trade financing the government has also provided support to firms for manpower costs she added ms low also reiterated that the government has taken steps

        "content": "singapore a new book released on thursday jan 20 has chronicled the first two years of singapore's fight against the covid 19 pandemic through the telling of pivotal behind the scenes moments and exclusive interviews in this together singapore's covid 19 story contains 13 chapters written by journalists from the straits times newsroom who have been in the thick of covering the crisis it is edited by executive editor sumiko tan the writers spoke to more than 300 people including prime minister lee hsien loong president halimah yacob cabinet ministers government officials corporate leaders front line workers volunteers foreign workers and survivors of the disease the 352 page book is divided into two parts saving lives where the efforts of the government healthcare sector and scientific community are documented and saving livelihoods which expounds on the parallel economic battle to preserve jobs businesses and singapore's hub status the opening chapter titled it took a village illustrates how 24 healthcare workers including doctors nurses therapists and housekeepers worked in tandem to help save the life of retired tutor irene tan 67 who had a severe covid 19 infection in march 2020 the next chapter inside the war room provides a detailed look at how singapore's leaders from pm lee to the multi ministry task force and the civil service's homefront crisis executive group tackled the most critical test faced by the city state in over a generation other highlights include the inside stories of how singapore procured masks amid frenzied global demand in the early days the bets and risks involved in purchasing vaccines and the concerted push by hospitals to step up capabilities while their overwhelmed staff endured struggles of their own the book which is published by straits times press also examines efforts to stamp out the virus in dormitories occupied by more than 300 000 foreign workers who made up 19 out of 20 infections in 2020 interspersed between chapters are profiles of pandemic front liners survivors and people who died from the virus putting this human touch to singapore's entire undertaking against covid 19 was a primary reason cited by ms tan in coming up with the book which comes almost exactly two years after singapore's first covid 19 case was detected on jan 23 2020 she said the book aims to pay tribute to front liners healthcare workers public servants those in essential services whom people often take for granted and while journalism did not entail front line activities such as swabbing or managing crowds ms tan said that what journalists could do was chronicle for future generations the events of the day so this period of history would not be forgotten if someone were to read this 20 years down the road they would understand what the first years of the pandemic were like how singaporeans felt and why we did what we did she added ms tan said that from the onset the team was clear that in this together was going to be a chronicle of singapore's fight rather than an assessment one major challenge for the project which started in august 2020 was the unfolding realisation that the pandemic was not going to go away any time soon she noted publication originally scheduled for the middle of 2021 was delayed thrice and stories had to be updated each time the delay allowed us to tell a fuller story she said but a decision had to be made on where to end the book and the new omicron variant provided that milestone case numbers are rising around the world but severe infections and hospitalisations are not and some scientists believe this could suggest the coming end of the pandemic in an introduction to the book straits times editor warren fernandez who is also editor in chief of sph media trust's english malay and tamil media group wrote the book is not meant to be triumphalist or self laudatory but an honest record of the most severe test singapore has faced in over a generation and which will continue for some time yet as the crisis is far from over straits times news editor karamjit kaur who co wrote a chapter on aviation said the book was a tough project as it had to take in the morphing virus and singapore's changing responses associate news editor chang ai lien who co wrote a chapter on hospitals added work on the book shadowed the trajectory of the virus with its numerous twists and turns the story is far from over ms kaur and ms chang helm the newsroom's own task force on covid 19 coverage health correspondent timothy goh who wrote several segments including singapore's hunt for masks said working on the book brought home to him how the pandemic has affected everyone young old rich poor minister migrant worker i also witnessed a very human and personal side to the officials we see in the media he said seeing the tiredness in their faces and hearing about the various doubts that were kept private till now reminded me that regardless of our station in life for the past two years we've also just been human beings trying to figure out a way to get through this together the book was supported by the ministry of communications and information in the form of book purchases the ministry also helped to arrange some of the interviews but left the shape of the book and the telling of the stories to the writing team in this together

        "content": "singapore the number of reported job scams during the covid 19 pandemic has skyrocketed warned the police as more people are lured by the convenience of easy jobs promising high commissions the revelation comes even as people are still reeling from the shock of at least 8 5 million that nearly 470 ocbc bank customers lost last year some had savings in the six figures wiped out in an exclusive interview with the straits times last week superintendent of police michelle tay the head of the anti scam centre said that police are seeing a continued increase in the number of victims falling prey to job scams this is despite outreach efforts being beefed up with more ammunition in the form of technology in the first six months of last year there were 658 cases of job scams a 16 fold increase from just 40 in the same period in 2020 victims of such scams lost about 6 5 million between january and june last year up from about 60 000 in the same period the year before the largest sum lost by a single victim in a job scam in the first half of last year was about 676 000 supt tay said the pandemic has only aggravated the problem with digital payments acting as a double edged sword she said during covid 19 the use of contact free digital payments increased this enhances our convenience but at the same time enhances the scammers' modes of operations they can easily create pseudo bank accounts to move funds supt tay outlined the five types of job scams the centre has encountered in recent months stressing that job scams are of particular concern as more people work from home the scams mostly involved victims being able to purportedly earn commissions by simply completing tasks on websites or mobile applications however the victims would at some point be told they needed to transfer a sum of money to receive such tasks and get their payouts the first type involved victims being instructed to download unverified mobile applications they are tasked to transfer funds in the form of cryptocurrency into their purported job accounts and are promised commission for completing tasks that appear to help businesses victims realise they have been scammed after they try to withdraw the commission from their accounts the second type appears to have evolved from the first those who fall victim to the first and try to quit and cash out would be sent warning letters claiming to bear the letterheads of the local authorities victims are pressured into making further transfers into bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets or face legal action there are also scams that involve supposed affiliate marketing and the sale of movie tickets operating in a similar fashion as the first type of scam the fifth and last type which is the most recent to have emerged appears to be the most insidious in a warning earlier this month the police said scammers invited victims to participate in jobs involving the sale of products on a fake mobile app called shopee pay the app which is unrelated to the e commerce platform shopee looks legitimate as scammers are spoofing an actual platform the unverified app is a spoof of shopee s real digital wallet called shopeepay which is accessed through the real shopee app shopee does not have a standalone app for its digital wallet within a month at least 11 people had already lost more than 50 000 in total after they were tricked into transferring funds to cryptocurrency wallets with fraudsters upping their game and the number of victims piling up supt tay said the authorities have turned to technology in their fight against scams we have leveraged technology and are streamlining internal processes to help us cope with the workload for example the anti scam centre has added robotic process automation to its arsenal with the technology driving project combat centralised operational messaging bot addressing threats which was launched on july 17 last year through collaboration with the singapore police force's intelligence and land division units the centre is able to detect numerous potential victims of job scams it used to take an average of 45 minutes to contact and warn just one person project combat uses robotic process automation to send out targeted sms advisories to select groups all at once enabling them to reach hundreds of people in mere minutes the centre has conducted more than 6 900 interventions this way through project combat the technology has freed up more time and resources for officers to take on other important tasks such as fund tracing supt tay added that aside from job scams project combat has been expanded to also tackle investment scams this is because potential victims of investment scams are reached by scammers in a similar fashion as those of job scams with scammers sending unsolicited messages to them in large chat groups similar automated warning messages the centre sends to potential victims of potential job scams can thus also be sent to potential victims of investment scams but there are limits to what can be done to recover funds victims transfer to scammers many of whom are based overseas supt tay urged members of the public to heed the warnings of the authorities and to take the threat of scams seriously she said the earlier you report the earlier we can take intervention action to intercept the funds everyone has

the botanic gardens on thursday morning the cinereous vulture was seen congregating with a group of five himalayan griffon vultures when the straits times arrived at around 9 30am the police and nparks staff were seen dispersing a crowd of bird enthusiasts blocking the footpath leading to the carpark near the national orchid garden singapore birds project member movin nyanasengeran said the vultures probably arrived as part of the migratory season this year which takes place between september and march they likely overshot their regular wintering ranges in thailand and flew almost 1 000km down the peninsula to singapore said the national university of singapore phd student the cinereous vulture is particularly noteworthy because this is the first record we have in singapore and it s the largest old world raptor he said according to singapore birds project the sooty vulture ranges between 1m and 1 2m tall the scavenger is native to europe and northern asia and can normally be found around forested areas in hills and mountains said nparks it spends winters mainly in northern india and the middle east mr movin said the himalayan griffon vultures are likely to be juveniles which sometimes lose their way on the migratory path the scavengers have been sighted over the past two years in hindhede quarry and the central business district both species of vultures are from the same family and can be found in the himalayas the cinereous vulture has a darker and more fully feathered head than the himalayan griffon vulture said mr movin and is slightly larger birdwatchers said it was likely a lack of food or fatigue that led to the weakened state of the cinereous vulture mr movin noted that it is rare but not uncommon for such large migrating raptors to crash and sometimes die because of tiredness and hunger lack of food is especially likely to plague the vulture here since they feed on large carcasses he said adding that the nearest place where people put out food for migrating vultures is phuket thailand is along the birds migratory path the chairman of the nature society s bird group mr tan gim cheong told the straits times that when he saw the vultures on wednesday afternoon the cinereous vulture had its eyes closed for periods of time while perched a sign that it was feeling weak on thursday it probably landed on the ground for the same reason it ended up in singapore said mr tan noting that the young vulture might have wandered to the end of continental south east asia in search of something to eat he said it may have failed to find food along its long journey and just continued flying until land s end dr loo added that members of the public should remain calm and observe a vulture from a distance in the event that they encounter the bird they should not approach provoke or feed the animal the public may also contact nparks at 1800 471 7300 to report the encounter he said cinereous vultures and himalayan griffon vultures primarily feed on animal carcasses and are unlikely to prey on people or live animals said dr loo the recent record follows a string of national firsts for migratory birds this year on nov 20 a long eared owl

        "content": "workers at the crossroads of their careers are bound to face some fear anxiety and uncertainty aware of these challenges faced by jobseekers workforce singapore wsg introduced its volunteer career advisors initiative last year tapping into the expertise of industry veterans to provide peer support and career guidance mr chok yean hung is one such industry captain the 57 year old wears many hats he spent over 30 years in the semiconductor industry was an engineer who travelled around the world for work and later became an entrepreneur who grew a number of companies before retiring last year with his wealth of experience mr chok now endeavours to help jobseekers navigate their career journeys by understanding their personalities and aspirations and recommending them the right support based on their needs through this volunteer career advisors initiative i hope to be able to help shine a torch into the semiconductor and electronics industry and attract more fellow workers to join its growth in singapore he says currently in sectors such as accountancy electronics healthcare information and communications technology ict and retail wsg's volunteer career advisors initiative provides opportunities for jobseekers to develop greater understanding of their industry of interest thereby helping them make informed career decisions with greater confidence here are more ways in which volunteer career advisors can assist you in furthering your career goals say you want to improve your career prospects by switching to another sector but are at a loss as to where to start or don't have the relevant background if you are facing this conundrum you can approach a volunteer career advisor for help drawing from their experiences in the respective sectors they can provide industry specific advice and insights to guide advisees in their job search process mr chok adds for advisees interested in the electronics and semiconductor industry for example i would share the various sub sectors and types of opportunities that can fit their aspirations i would also share through my past experiences what it takes to successfully pursue a career within these opportunities jobseekers can consult volunteer career advisors to gain a better understanding of an industry in order to be better prepared as they embark on their career journeys armed with the additional support and guidance you can even consider consulting different volunteer career advisors from various industries for deeper insight into the sectors that could potentially be a good fit for you says mr chok being experts in their field volunteer career advisors are well placed to identify and address possible skill gaps required to switch to and advance in specific sectors while the approach of individual advisors may vary all volunteer career advisors believe in connecting with their advisees on a peer to peer level says mr chok prior to offering guidance to advisees it is key to know their aspirations and areas of competency only then can appropriate guidance be given be it the type of complementary skill sets needed or wsg's various programmes to enhance an individual's market value so they can progress in their careers after gaining an understanding of his advisees' career aspirations backgrounds and transferable skills mr chok then supports them by addressing career gaps and recommending relevant initiatives and programmes that can help them upskill and plug these gaps he has also counselled individuals on how they can successfully nail a job interview by articulating the unique value they can bring to the hiring company mr chok shares an example of an advisee who had lost his confidence after facing many rejections from interviewers he had been let go from his job in the electronics industry but was keen to remain in the sector the advisee went for many interviews yet was not successful in securing a position despite studying the companies before every interview so he thinks the reason lies in him not having sufficient knowledge of the companies' solutions or products after listening to him recount his experiences mr chok felt that the advisee needed to articulate the value he could bring to the company instead of trying to impress the interviewer with his knowledge of the business he explains no interviewer would expect a candidate to be well versed with its solutions or products so to help him move forward i advised him to focus on highlighting his key competencies and transferable skills before his next interview a month later the advisee managed to successfully land a job the volunteer career advisors initiative offers a flexible way for you to broaden your support network and potentially gain an industry mentor advisees can choose the duration and number of sessions according to their needs for mr chok connecting with his advisees goes beyond a simple zoom chat to him forging a personal connection is important because it allows advisees to develop trust in him which will help them feel more at ease when discussing their personal challenges and aspirations i prefer meeting face to face at a convenient location as an in person conversation makes it easier to connect i'd try to build rapport by asking advisees about their current situation where they want to go and what they want to do it is important to help them distinguish the differences between career aspiration or desperation as the anxiety caused by the latter may cause them to settle for an unsuitable career he says mr chok's commitment to his advisees stems from his own experiences he credits his peers supervisors customers and friends as mentors who have shared their learnings and helped him to excel at different stages of his career there were times when my mentors had pointed out areas that have blind sided me the key was really to be willing to listen and learn from them as they shared their experiences with me this is how we can challenge ourselves to do better and grow in our careers he says take the next step in advancing your career connect with one of wsg's volunteer career advisors today join st's telegram channel here

        "content": "singapore the disordered roll out of new testing and isolation protocols was one of the factors that led to delays in moving covid 19 positive workers living in the westlite jalan tukang dormitory to off site care and recovery facilities mr yeo guat kwang the chairman of the migrant workers' centre mwc said this in a media statement on wednesday oct 20 adding that logistical and resource challenges in the transfer of workers to care facilities and an unexpected spike in infections among residents in the dormitory also played a part mwc and representatives of the shipbuilding and marine engineering employees' union visited the jurong dorm last friday mr yeo said that most of the workers' concerns regarding newly implemented safe management measures and covid 19 testing and isolation protocols were resolved within a day after their plight was covered on local media last thursday among the new measures implemented at dorms since the start of this month are that fully vaccinated workers who test positive for covid 19 and have no symptoms are to isolate and recover in a dedicated facility within their dormitory for up to 10 days while workers with symptoms are given a polymerase chain reaction test and sent to a community care facility or hospital depending on their condition mr yeo said workers whom mwc spoke to confirmed that the authorities promptly resolved the situation by working with the dormitory operator and employers to rectify the delays and bring order and stability back to the dormitory he added they also told us that since the improvements were made the transfer process for covid 19 positive cases had become more timely and they hoped that the smoother process would continue the dormitory came under the spotlight last week after reports of delays in workers with covid 19 being sent to care facilities things came to a head when workers gathered en masse to voice their frustrations last wednesday and riot police were deployed to the vicinity mr yeo said a team from mwc and representatives from the union had visited the dormitory to confirm that issues raised were being addressed to check on the residents' physical and emotional states and to assist them in resolving any lingering employment or well being issues though many others had already been moved from the dormitory and many of the remaining residents had not returned from work at the time of the visit they were able to engage with about 200 migrant workers during the visit mr yeo said they learnt that some of the migrant workers did not understand the reasons and strategy behind the new safe management measures and testing and isolation protocols which might have contributed to the confusion and disorder he added that the team has given this feedback to the ministry of manpower mom and is working urgently with the ministry to address this mr yeo said that through the ambassadors and other communication channels including mwc's 24 hour helpline it will also be monitoring the situation on the implementation of the new protocols and will surface any other irregularities or delays immediately for mom's attention pictures of food that workers were given that was spoilt or contained insects had been circulated online and mr yeo said mwc understands that the authorities are investigating the matter he added that though the mwc team and union representatives were not able to meet anyone who encountered such food many of the workers they spoke to said there were sometimes issues with the timeliness and quantity of the meals but that this was rectified after controls were put in place by authorities and employers migrant workers had told the team that more could be done to ensure that the catered food meets the tastes and dietary preferences of the workers especially those from china as those coming china have a wide range of dietary preferences based on where they are from mr yeo said it can sometimes take time to reach the optimal catering arrangements for them and while this was explained to them the workers were told that it is an endeavour that the employer must do right we repeated to the chinese migrant workers that their employer had committed to put more attention and resources into working out the most optimal dietary preference solutions as soon as possible and reassured them that we too would continue to monitor the progress of this aspect mr yeo mr yeo added that his team was told that up until the week before oct 13 the chinese workers were able to make online purchases of more familiar chinese sundries groceries and rations unobtainable from the dormitory's on site minimart which would be delivered to them in the dormitory and allow them to supplement their catered food with more familiar dietary options the workers explained that these deliveries to the dormitory were stopped a week earlier accentuating the less than optimal catering situation in response to queries from the straits times mr kong chee min chief executive of centurion corporation which manages nine dorms under the westlite brand said the dormitory receives parcels for the residents if they are out or at work and informs them to collect them later he added that residents order items in bulk or even palette loads for distribution or resale among their fellow residents and that can impede activity in essential operations areas such as security counters and fire engine access it also interferes with safe living measures and safe distancing controls hence when the number of positive cases rose the

restart the deliveries to the dormitory and mr yeo said the residents appreciated the return of this additional service mr yeo said the engagement also raised certain concerns that some migrant

also continue to monitor these new measures as well as the sentiment and condition of the migrant workers in response mr yeo thanked the welfare and corporate organisations that have stepped forward

friday jan 7 this includes teaching pre schoolers aged four to six body safety awareness and to seek help from adults when they feel hurt or unsafe the training of current and new educators will also be improved in this aspect as part of the enhancement of support to pre schools to instil body safety skills in young children by msf and the early childhood development agency ecda msf said through age appropriate programmes young children will be equipped with knowledge and skills to respect body boundaries both theirs and others' differentiate between good and bad touches and to tell trusted adults if they are touched inappropriately or feel unsafe msf s child protective service investigated 261 child sex abuse cases in 2020 according to statistics published by the ministry last year s numbers have not been released minister of state for social and family development and education sun xueling visited pcf sparkletots sengkang central block 208 on friday morning and observed a body safety lesson carried out with a kindergarten 2 class through videos songs and age appropriate discussions children learnt about their body what constitutes good and bad touches and how to protect themselves ms sun said knowledge of body safety is essential in preventing sexual abuse and domestic violence it is important to teach our children about body safety from a young age so that children can protect themselves when others touch them inappropriately children are also taught to speak up and report to trusted adults when they feel unsafe as part of the ministry of education's ongoing review of the nurturing early learners framework which spells out the learning outcomes of pre school education pre school teachers will be encouraged to teach children safety behaviours the revised framework will be launched at the end of this year with training planned for pre schools on the key enhancements new educators joining the early childhood sector will also soon be better equipped to teach children how to protect themselves following enhancements in training while pre service certificate and diploma programmes offered by private training agencies already incorporate concepts of child abuse and neglect ecda is working closely with the agencies to enhance the content similarly programmes by the national institute of early childhood development have been enhanced after it worked with the singapore children's society scs current educators will be encouraged to attend a course titled empowering children with body safety skills offered by scs that will help them better understand child sexual abuse issues and use appropriate strategies to handle disclosures of such incidents they will also be equipped to conduct the kidzlive i can protect myself programme which enables children to learn body safety skills along with follow up activities to enforce children's learning msf and its community partners have also reached out to pre schools such as e bridge pre school and etonhouse pre school to organise family violence awareness training for about 190 early childhood educators staff and volunteers the training was recently enhanced to equip participants to identify and respond appropriately to the signal for help hand sign which can be used by anyone including children who have been exposed to family violence but are not able to verbalise their need for help there have also been ongoing efforts to train pre school centre leaders in the sector specific screening guide and the child abuse reporting guide evidence based tools that guide professionals on managing reports of suspected child abuse and how to follow up to ensure the children are kept safe msf said it will continue to expand outreach efforts to more pre schools this year ms lin xiaoling deputy director of the research and advocacy group at scs told the straits times that the society is very glad to know there will be more concerted effort to provide pre school educators with training to impart body safety skills teaching this to children in schools allows for standardised learning across different backgrounds and creates a safe space for abuse at home to come to light ms lin added research has shown that perpetrators are less likely to target children who have knowledge of body safety skills as sexual abuse is often shrouded in secrecy children who have been taught are more likely to be able to recognise inappropriate actions and to tell someone about these acts if the abuse had taken place the suffering can be cut short when children tell out at pcf sparkletots and discussing with our educators about the body safety classes they have with their k2 students i had just seen a group of k2 students finish their body safety class they enjoyed it very much jasmine is the centre principal and brenda is the teacher in charge during brenda s lesson she goes through what are the private body parts and what are safe and unsafe touches she then shows the children a cartoon video and discusses scenarios children may face and helps them understand what are safe and unsafe situations and to share with a trusted adult if they come across a unsafe touch or a person who touches them and makes them feel unsafe we then end off with a song to reiterate the main points with our children watch the video below to find out more about the lesson plan pap community foundation pcf singapore s largest pre school operator is planning to launch its own body safety toolkit in the middle of the year for all its pre schools with kindergarten services said pcf s deputy director of professional and education development angela yang this toolkit will include resources and activities that are engaging to make the topics easier for children to understand ms yang said there are stories and songs for educators to use in the classroom where they can also facilitate age appropriate discussions as children learn more effectively from storytelling and songs we want to make it easy for them to learn and understand through interactive elements here are some tips from the singapore children s society for parents to pass on body safety messages to their children teach your child to differentiate between good and bad touches help your child understand that his body belongs to him if he feels uncomfortable when someone touches or kisses him he should ask the person to stop he should also tell a trusted adult if this happens inform your child that familiar people may also do bad things to him often sexual abuse is committed by adults whom children are familiar with children need to understand that they should always seek help and tell a trusted adult if a secret makes them feel scared or upset practice the n o t rules say no walk out tell a trusted adult your child may not fully understand what a trusted adult means you can help your child by naming a few people whom he can turn to when he needs help get the st smart parenting newsletter for expert

        "content": "singapore changes to the women's charter to allow couples to divorce without citing faults like adultery will not lead to quick and easy divorces said minister of state for social and family development sun xueling such divorces by mutual agreement as they are called mean spouses will not need to pin blame on each other adding to the tension at home however the new approach will come with safeguards to prevent people from seeking an easy way out of their troubled marriages she said in parliament on monday jan 10 speaking during the debate on amendments to the women's charter which covers non muslim divorces ms sun said those seeking divorce after the new rules come into force will have to for instance show that they have made efforts to reconcile also the court has the power not to grant a divorce if it feels that reconciliation is reasonably possible she added ms sun said the new divorce by mutual agreement approach is unlike the no fault divorces adopted in other countries where couples are not required to prove that their marriage has broken down irretrievably or one side alone can file for divorce this is because in singapore a couple have to agree that the marriage has broken down beyond repair and explain to the court the reasons that led to this conclusion and in doing so they take responsibility for their marital woes she said a bare agreement without reasons is not enough ms sun said she added that reasons could include deep seated differences in values and the aim is to avoid reasons that pin blame on only one party also one side alone cannot divorce the other by the mutual agreement option besides a couple must be wed for at least three years before they can file for divorce this rule is already in place now all the other safeguards of the current divorce framework such as the three month period before the divorce is finalised also still stand ms sun said hence divorce by mutual agreement strikes a balance between the fact that marriage is a public institution and a serious matter and that when it has truly broken down the law should permit divorce without creating unnecessary acrimony she said the amendments to the women's charter were passed on monday jan 10 after a four hour debate during which 16 mps spoke the divorce by mutual agreement option is expected to come into effect next year ms sun said the ministry of social and family development msf held consultations with those involved in the divorce process such as divorcees lawyers and social workers this also comes after a review of the family justice system to focus on therapeutic justice where divorcing couples are not positioned as adversaries in court but work together to co parent after the divorce we found that where parties agree on the divorce having to cite one of the existing facts may force parties to point fingers at each other as they cite reasons to prove one of the three fault based facts or dredge up past hurts to prove the facts this can cause the child to be caught in the middle as allegations of misdeeds are being made by either or both of their parents against the other if they cite separation as a fact they have to put their lives on hold for the three or four years of separation before filing for divorce this can be harmful to the couple and their children as the relationship between the couple would likely be tense and unstable during the period of separation ms sun said now the three fault based facts for divorce are adultery desertion and unreasonable behaviour there are also two facts of separation three years separation with spouse s consent or four years without consent hence divorce by mutual agreement of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is the sixth fact for divorce ms sun said this new option is not a simple handshake of a mutual agreement to divorce as couples have to tell the courts why their marriage broke down irretrievably they also need to show what effort they have made to reconcile and their considerations in post divorce arrangements involving the children and finances the courts can order a couple to go for counselling or mediation for example and that could salvage the marriage or confirm that reconciliation is impossible first sitting of parliament in the new year today sun xueling moved amendments to the women s charter to make the the courts could also reject the couple's agreement to end the marriage if it considers that reconciliation is reasonably possible she said ms sun said for instance if cases where previous efforts at reconciliation were few and insufficient and where reasons provided on the breakdown of the marriage appear vague and arbitrary and where parties do not seem entirely certain of their decision the court may choose not to accept the agreement the amendments to the women's charter also included a raft of other changes including the strengthening of the enforcement measures to get parents to comply with court orders to give the other parent access to their child post divorce these other divorce related amendments are expected to come into effect in the later half of this year there will also be a new registry of marriages portal where couples can complete their pre solemnisation requirements online family lawyer angelina hing said couples will not opt for divorce just because the process to get one has become easier but because they no longer want to remain married mr arthur ling chief executive of fei yue community services said for couples who have tried their best to save

with the introduction of dma a divorce process is not made easier or faster as it still requires parties to be married for at least three years and wait three months for their divorce to be finalised said minister of state for social and family development sun xueling she said this in response to queries from workers' party mp sylvia lim aljunied grc and other mps during a debate on a bill to introduce amendments to the women's charter in parliament on monday jan 10 ms lim had asked if there was a risk that divorces would become too easy with the introduction of dma as the requirements for divorce have been arguably relaxed she noted that dma did not have time requirements like those stipulated for other facts such as adultery and unreasonable behaviour where the offended spouse must not have continued to live with the offending spouse for more than six months after the last incident in her response ms sun said the divorce process remains largely the same no matter which fact is cited and that citing dma requires individuals to make further submissions to the court such as their efforts at reconciliation and their considerations on arrangements concerning their children or financial affairs a balance must be struck between making it too difficult for couples to divorce and making it too easy to give up their commitment ms sun said sixteen mps spoke during the debate on the bill on monday raising concerns on whether dma would effectively reduce acrimony between divorcing spouses and if the minimum three year period for a couple to remain married was necessary ms carrie tan nee soon grc asked if couples in some cases should be allowed to divorce before the three year mark she cited cases where individuals may find out intolerable issues about their spouse only after marriage such as chronic infidelity a tendency towards violence that surfaces after the honeymoon period or history of debilitating financial debt that renders a marriage unreasonably difficult while there is currently a clause allowing for divorce before the three year mark in cases of exceptional hardship ms tan noted that is was a subjective interpretation in her response ms sun said the three year minimum period was important to ensure that couples do not enter or exit a marriage lightly and the time would allow couples to adjust seek help and overcome difficulties in their marriage first sitting of parliament in the new year today sun xueling moved amendments to the women s charter to make the responding to questions by mr lim biow chuan mr ang wei neng mr melvin yong and mr yip hon weng on how dma differs from no fault divorce in other jurisdictions ms sun noted that dma requires parties to give a reason for the breakdown of their marriage prove reconciliation efforts and lay down considerations about children and financial matters ms hany soh marsiling yew tee grc asked what type of reasons are accepted to prove that the marriage has irretrievably broken down under dma in response ms sun cited reasons such as a deep seated difference in values where the intention was to avoid blaming only one party regarding acrimony between divorcing spouses mr lim biow chuan mountbatten noted that dma still requires parties to state in writing why they believe their marriage has irretrievably broken down when parties have to cite the reasons for concluding that the marriage has broken down irretrievably it is inevitable that there would be some accusations against the other parties could still fight tooth and nail regarding custody care and control over the children they fight over the division of assets and they also fight over maintenance he said while acknowledging that some couples would face acrimony in their divorce proceedings even with dma ms sun said providing the option for parties to jointly take responsibility rather than pinning the blame solely on one party would more likely set the frame and mindset for a less acrimonious and conflictual process this in turn could lead them to be more amicable when deciding ancillary matters like custody of children and financial assets she added noting the impact of family law on families and individuals ms mariam jaafar sembawang grc asked if the government would consider putting in place accreditation standards and monitoring processes for professionals working in family law such as

        "content": "singapore the courts will now have powers to better enforce child access orders particularly in cases where parents with care and control of children deny their former spouses access to the children new amendments to the women's charter passed in parliament on monday jan 10 include a raft of measures such as mandatory counselling compensation for denied access and in extreme cases a jail term and fine for parents who deny child access to the former spouse the amendments also include educating couples on parenting mediation therapeutic programmes or family support programmes harsher measures include compensation expenses for instance if a parent paid for holiday accommodation or travel fare for their children but was deprived of child access by their former spouse as well as arranging for additional access if the former spouse was denied access to the child also included are performance bonds and security pledges and in certain cases fines or imprisonment in her opening speech at the second reading of the bill in parliament on monday minister of state for social and family development sun xueling noted that it could be a difficult and time consuming process for parents who do not have care and control of their children to seek recourse in cases where there is a breach of the child access order currently where there is non compliance with a child access order the only recourse for the access parent is to commence committal proceedings or apply for care and control orders pertaining to the children to be varied ms sun said the issue has been exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic when movement between households posed a risk of infection transmission a report by the straits times in april 2020 found that former spouses were facing more difficulties in meeting their children and fulfilling their maintenance order commitments during this period ms sun said we understand that there are divorced parents who struggle to gain access to their children we sympathise with this and trust that these new measures will help to address this nonetheless we would like to reiterate that in such issues it is in the child's best interest for parents to resolve these issues through effective communication and mutual understanding and legal measures should be a last resort in addition to better enforcement of child access orders the amendments to the women's charter also make provisions to better support couples who are undergoing a divorce and their children all divorcing couples with minor children will have to attend the mandatory parenting programme mpp so as to encourage cooperation in parenting matters between the couple currently only couples who are divorcing under the standard track where they are contesting the divorce have to attend the programme the mpp encourages parents to make informed decisions that prioritise the well being of their children and helps parents understand the importance of co parenting and the practical issues arising from a divorce ms sun said children of divorcing parents could also be ordered to attend the programme for children if the court deems it beneficial this covers a range of support for children including an assessment of the needs of the child as well as specific interventions such as group programmes counselling or psychological services the government will also suggest changes to strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders in singapore under proposed amendments to appropriate legislation this year according to ms angelina hing managing director at integro law chambers when seen as a part of the suite of amendments under the women's charter the child access enforcement powers given to the court is to send a message to parents intending to divorce that there are many avenues and assistance given to them to resolve issues amicably but if they choose to contest and adopt an unreasonable stance there are consequences and some of these consequences are now made explicit she added if parents are properly educated and advised and come to understand that an acrimonious divorce would only cause harm to the child and drain their resources then hopefully these parents would make more rationale decisions on all issues including the ones involving custody care and control and access join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "singapore life will never return to exactly the way it was before the pandemic experts told the straits times this view was shared by 28 per cent of respondents in an online survey of 1 000 people commissioned by the straits times and conducted by market research firm milieu insight from jan 6 to 10 the respondents who are all singaporeans are representative of the singaporean population aged 16 and above by age and gender nine per cent said they believed life in singapore in 2022 would return to the way it was before the pandemic while 32 per cent believed this would happen in 2023 another 31 per cent thought this would happen later than 2023 separately 52 per cent said that at the start of 2021 they had believed that life would have returned to a pre pandemic normal by the end of 2021 associate professor natasha howard from the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health and her colleague assistant professor hannah clapham both said that life would not fully return to the way it was before the pandemic but prof howard added that not all changes are bad for example normalisation of flexible and remote working education and healthcare increases access for those who might otherwise be excluded due to caring responsibilities disabilities and so on she said prof clapham said we are heading to a new normal where covid 19 will have fundamentally changed much of how we live our lives but we should expect to be able to resume more and more activities with fewer and fewer restrictions professor dale fisher senior consultant at the national university hospital's division of infectious diseases said that he believed most things would return to the pre pandemic way of life i don't believe singapore will mandate mask wearing forever nor prevent large gatherings indefinitely its just not the way people want to live and the absence of such restrictions overseas will influence public opinion here on the other hand virtual meetings telemedicine and work from home arrangements will persist but not for pandemic reasons added prof fisher it's because these have a role in our lives now and their introduction was expedited by the pandemic the experts were also asked what they thought of the government's handling of the pandemic in 2021 prof howard pointed out that the government's evidence informed and logical approach had led to better public responses and outcomes than in some other high income countries in 2021 prof clapham felt that the government had taken a rational and balanced approach which considered both public health and economic outcomes meanwhile 36 per cent of respondents to st's survey said that compared with the start of 2020 they felt either slightly or much more confident in the government's ability to handle the covid 19 situation in 2022 while 29 per cent felt either slightly or much less confident forty per cent of respondents felt that the impact of the pandemic here in 2021 had been worse or much worse than they expected while 38 per cent said it had the same impact as they had predicted compared with those aged 45 and up those aged 44 and below were more likely to favour quicker reopening even if it meant potentially more infections and deaths overall however a majority 63 per cent favoured reopening more slowly to keep infections and deaths to a minimum followed by 27 per cent who were okay with reopening at the current rate prof fisher said that several parameters should be considered when assessing a nation's performance against the coronavirus he noted that when the nation was still trying to contain the virus it maintained its contact tracing system which some other countries had abandoned as well as an aggressive testing regimen with easily accessible free testing it was able to act on such early identification by maintaining supervised isolation of positive cases this meant cases and clusters that occurred could be limited he added that while other countries flipped in and out of harsh social restrictions including lockdowns throughout 2021 singapore maintained a more consistent and moderate stance noting that singapore had quickly rolled out its vaccine programme prof fisher added arguably the major weakness in this effort was the delay in seniors' vaccine uptake this resulted in greater mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable group it could still be debated if mandating vaccine in this age group or an earlier more proactive effort which eventually came would have made a difference there was a disappointing resistance to vaccination by some seniors not generally seen overseas professor josip car director of the centre for population health sciences at the nanyang technological university's lee kong chian school of medicine said he felt the government had been exceptionally efficient in adapting to new developments during the pandemic safety management measures were promptly revised for relevance as and when informed by the latest scientific advances from increased testing and contact tracing precision to home based recovery scheme singapore has emerged much more resilient to handling covid 19 and its variants in 2021 he said noting that singapore had one of the lowest mortality and highest vaccination rates in the world he added however we must not forget the sacrifices made to achieve singapore's progress and current success restrictions to stop or slow the spread of the virus often have a heavy toll on many aspects of life economy and society join st's telegram channel here and

disruptions and an online shopping boom according to data provided by changi airport group cag on friday dec 31 total airfreight throughput from january to november in 2021 hit 1 76 million tonnes 96 per cent of the 1 84 million tonnes reached over the same period in pre pandemic 2019 it was also a 26 per cent jump from the 1 4 million tonnes moved from january to november 2020 when throughput for the full year fell to 1 54 million tonnes from 2 01 million tonnes in 2019 at the height of pandemic restrictions and lockdowns worldwide cag noted that throughput for september and october last year surpassed 2019 benchmarks with air imports and exports from january to november last year exceeding pre pandemic levels by 8 per cent air imports exports and transshipments are the primary components of air cargo movements as at the first week of december 2021 changi airport was registering some 1 000 weekly scheduled and charter cargo flights including passenger aircraft converted to carry cargo in their holds connecting the hub to more than 70 cities this is a more than threefold increase compared with december 2019 last year more than 50 passenger airlines launched more than 23 000 flights carrying only cargo to and from changi airport there were more than 540 weekly freighter only flights as at the first week of december a rise of 72 per cent from december 2019 the introduction of new freighter operators to changi airport over the past two years has helped minimise supply chain disruptions by supporting the flow of essential goods such as personal protective equipment pharmaceuticals and food supplies said cag most recently on dec 25 south korean budget carrier air premia launched a weekly flight from incheon city to singapore using converted passenger planes to bring in covid 19 test kits e commerce goods fabric and agricultural products including strawberries outbound cargo includes perfumes cosmetics food products and electronic parts air imports and exports between singapore and south korea grew by 6 per cent for the january to november period last year compared with 2019 air premia follows the addition of australia's tasman cargo in june and india's spicejet in february last year as well as china's yto cargo in november 2020 and american airline kalitta in april earlier that year there was also the reinstatement of scheduled freighter flights in 2020 by china's sf airlines in august and turkish cargo in october singapore is a key air hub in asia at the centre of passenger and cargo traffic thus changi was chosen as a priority destination for asia said mr sean c kang air premia's senior executive vice president of air cargo business he added that the carrier expects to handle transshipments in future and operate passenger flights once singapore's quarantine free vaccinated travel lane vtl programme is extended to air premia in october to meet surging e commerce demand delivery giant fedex express doubled its weekly flights between sydney and singapore and added a new weekly flight connecting the city state with paris mr lim ching kiat managing director of cag's air hub development acknowledged that the pandemic's severe impact on the aviation industry has taken a toll on business changi airport's latest annual report ending march 2021 revealed that the hub had sunk into the red for the first time with large percentage drops across the board in passenger traffic aircraft movement and retail operations air cargo's dip of 23 per cent was less significant in comparison changi airport group has worked closely with industry partners to facilitate airfreight movements which has supported the singapore economy and ensured the flow of essential goods globally said mr lim with our partners we are also driving efforts to digitise the air cargo supply chain and build long term resilience with a stronger freighter network these efforts will strengthen the changi air cargo hub to meet the challenges of tomorrow changi airport's recovery reflects the latest air cargo trends reported by the international air transport association which in december noted that global demand as at october last year was up 9 4 per cent compared with 2019 this growth was 3 6 per cent for asia pacific markets noting an overall positive outlook the global airline body's director general willie walsh pointed to increased passenger travel bringing more belly capacity for air cargo but he also warned of government responses to the new covid 19 variant omicron understood to be more transmissible though less severe than the delta variant dampening travel demand after almost two years of covid 19 governments have the experience and tools to make better data driven decisions than the mostly knee jerk reactions to restrict travel that we have seen to date said mr walsh singapore has suspended until jan 20 the sale of tickets for arriving flights and buses under its vtl programme as it braces

        "content": "singapore takeaway has significantly outpaced delivery as the preferred method of getting food this year amid constant changes in covid 19 safe management measures and limits on dining capacities takeaway orders from restaurants fast food restaurants and cafes and coffee houses rose significantly year on year in the third quarter compared with the same period last year according to the customer satisfaction index of singapore survey whose results were released on tuesday nov 30 the annual survey by the institute of service excellence ise at singapore management university assesses consumer attitudes towards the food and beverage f b and tourism sectors a total of 2 600 people were surveyed this year between july and september among the questions respondents were asked if they dined out took home or ordered food delivery for their most recent meal they were also asked which of the three options they preferred the most for each of three categories of f b venues restaurants fast food restaurants and cafes and coffee houses with regard to respondents' most recent meal takeaway orders from all three venue categories rose significantly to 32 7 per cent from 25 9 per cent at restaurants 57 4 per cent from 49 4 per cent at fast food restaurants and 50 7 per cent from 40 2 per cent at cafes and coffee houses in comparison the proportion of customers dining in fell to 46 4 per cent from 52 8 per cent at restaurants 21 5 per cent from 27 8 per cent at fast food restaurants and 35 per cent from 43 8 per cent at cafes and coffee houses meanwhile the proportion of customers ordering through food delivery platforms remained almost similar to that in the previous year falling slightly to 20 9 per cent from 21 2 per cent at restaurants 21 1 per cent from 22 7 per cent at fast food restaurants and 14 2 per cent from 16 per cent at cafes and coffee houses ise head of research and consulting chen yongchang said the rise in takeaways appears to be in response to the heightened safe management restrictions and concerns over the covid 19 situation during the survey period while the data indicates the majority of consumers still prefer dine in when given a choice takeaway orders are likely to remain elevated for some time mr chen suggested that the shift to takeaway could be due to deals and cost savings on self pickup instead of having food delivered or even the convenience as more people are out and about as the economy opens up he said this is a behaviour that can probably be leveraged he also noted that takeaway orders tend to have better margins for eateries as they cut out the middlemen such as delivery platforms thus f b businesses aiming to grow the segment and strengthen their dine in offerings should smooth out ordering processes for customers in the store instead of focusing on delivery orders he added the survey showed that customers of cafes and coffee houses were markedly less satisfied and loyal this was especially so for those who ordered takeaway with a notable decline in how they rated attributes such as beverage quality and staff proactiveness the takeaway customers of this venue category also rated the in store ordering process relatively poorly compared with customers using food delivery platforms dine in customers said they also had a poorer in store ordering experience said mr chen while food quality quantity and variety remain key drivers of repeat visits to any f b establishment managers should also look into improving their team members' service delivery on the tourism front there was a significant shift in the profile of visitors with results showing a larger proportion of older visitors in particular the proportion of visitors in the 50 to 69 age segment rose to 22 3 per cent this year from 14 2 per cent last year in contrast visitors in the 30 to 49 age segment fell to 50 9 per cent from 56 9 per cent ms neeta lachmandas executive director of ise said the shifting demographic is likely due to the unique circumstances brought about by covid 19 travel restrictions with visitors across a more diverse demographic partaking in domestic tourism and visiting places they would not otherwise normally she added in fact half of the respondents we interviewed said they had made use of their singaporediscovers vouchers for their visit according to the survey the 50 to 69 age group rated their satisfaction level at attractions the lowest said mr chen this might present itself as a market that the industry could tap he added it seems that older customers are potentially underserved and the least satisfied among all the age groups so if the pattern continues operators may want to refocus their attractions to cater to this clientele join st's telegram

food rescuer who wanted to be known only as ms cassie i tell them to eat the cooked food immediately while it's hot if anything happens i would feel terrible eateries are in a constant war against food loving bacteria that can cause food poisoning and severe health issues this is why food rescuers businesses and food charities take painstaking measures to ensure that surplus food that is donated is safe and hygienic both to protect the recipients' health as well as their own reputations but a proposed law could protect businesses donating the food from being sued or prosecuted if a recipient gets food poisoning for instance as long as the food complies with strict safety and hygiene laws at the point of donation the proposed good samaritan food donation bill is the brainchild of nee soon grc mp louis ng who hopes to introduce it through a private member's bill next year the proposed law aims to cut singapore's food waste problem a major waste stream here which has grown by about 20 per cent over the past decade food waste comprised about 11 per cent of the total waste generated last year only 19 per cent of the 665 000 tonnes of food waste was recycled it is not yet clear if ground up food rescue and zero waste groups like divert for 2nd life which ms cassie volunteers with will be covered under the proposed bill the singaporean who is in her 50s said her hardscrabble childhood in a large family made minimising waste and dumpster diving jaunts with her mother a way of life she now picks up unsold meals vegetables and fruits and baked goods from eateries and hotels at least five times a week currently unemployed she has been active with divert for 2nd life for a few months before sharing the food with her malaysian flatmates and migrant workers she makes sure to reheat the frozen or chilled food in a pressure cooker to almost 100 deg c she once stayed up till 2am to cook up a batch of fried rice using unsold rice and cooked vegetables collected from a chinese restaurant in joo chiat the base of the rice pack had become soggy but not one to waste food she salvaged the good portions and cooked it with the vegetables adding spices and herbs between july and september this year an online public consultation conducted by the good samaritan legislation review committee which is helmed by mr ng found strong support for the liability waiver about 75 per cent of more than 330 respondents were also in favour of similar protections for logistics providers for food donation charities hotels and food charities welcome the proposed law saying it will reassure and encourage more food outlets to donate surplus food instead of binning it at the end of each day among those practising this is millennium hotels and resorts whose six hotels donate more than 800 bento boxes of surplus food each month to a community organisation that rescues and diverts excess food a spokesman for the hotel group however highlighted legal hoops in the food donation process this includes drawing up indemnity agreements to cover any potential issues that might arise from the donations at marina bay sands well oiled procedures in the kitchens ensure that unserved cooked food is certified safe before being handed over to the food bank singapore fbsg among other protocols the cooked food must be blast chilled and each ingredient scrutinised the fear of liability is the key obstacle that prevents many food businesses from donating their unsold food noted fbsg co founder nicholas ng who is also a member of the review committee the fear of liability and accountability is real in our conversations with f b establishments over the past several years many raise this issue as no protocol or processes are in place to manage food donations he said restaurant chain nando's donates about 20 unsold whole chickens and 70 chicken parts to fbsg every week the chain had previously done a lab test to check for bacteria on chicken pieces that were reheated after they had been stored in a freezer for a week to confirm that the food was safe under the proposed law the review committee is looking into introducing stringent codes for food donation according to singapore's food waste management hierarchy published in the national environment agency's website redistributing excess food is prioritised over recycling and treating food waste but the most ideal solution is to avoid wasting food at the onset by optimising the use of ingredients since 2015 grand hyatt singapore has donated more than 10 tonnes of excess food from its restaurants and kitchens to about 400 families said mr steffan heerdt the hotel's executive sous chef he added hotels and restaurants would probably have challenges with timely and well organised logistics to ensure that the unsold food is repacked and handed off to a food charity partner in time to be safe for consumption when it reaches beneficiaries while food charities are optimistic that more unsold food will be donated instead of thrown away if the bill is passed they are wary about being at the receiving end of excessive low quality food we are looking for quality food donations good donations that beneficiaries can benefit from said food from the heart chief executive sim bee hia who is also a member of the review committee agreeing mr ng added the singapore food agency needs to be involved to provide guidelines on what food items can be donated and safely consumed it's to ensure that people do not take advantage of this bill to treat charities as dumpsters in the online consultation 63 per cent of respondents agreed that businesses that donate food to food charities should be allowed to claim associated business expenses as deductions against their revenue eight in 10 also said tax exemptions should be provided for food businesses and food charities to buy specialised equipment such as blast chillers ms sim cautioned the liability waiver or tax incentives should not tilt the balance so much that we become such an easy alternative and become a dumping ground ms charmaine yap secretary of the review committee said food rescue groups may be considered as food charitable organisations for the purposes of the bill but those that save expired food for instance may not be eligible zero food waste advocates who accept expired food say they share it with people who can discern if the food is still edible using sight and smell we would also emphasise that even if food rescue groups don't qualify as food charitable organisations the bill will not change how they currently carry out their work ms yap added food charities may also need to be accredited under the proposed bill to ensure that there are safeguards in place for food safety and hygiene even if they have institution of a public character ipc status as to the precise requirements and content of any accreditation this is something that we are consulting with the stakeholders ministries and agencies on said ms yap the review committee will meet with food charities and groups next month to discuss a proposed accreditation scheme food from the heart is supportive of an accreditation ms sim said when you talk about accreditation beyond ipc it's more about the food charity's track record the number of beneficiaries it serves and sustainable giving the accreditation would help donors or food businesses differentiate who they want to work with that would ultimately help to streamline food support in singapore and be more efficient join st's telegram

christmas this year with the world's first soya wine and other food innovations made from soya whey a liquid by product of tofu manufacturing sachi is also the first wine produced in singapore it is made by local food start up sinfootech which spent five years developing a patented fermentation process to turn whey into wine according to its chief executive mr jonathan ng a tofu factory can produce up to 200 tonnes of soya whey each day he said while sachi is an example of reusing something that would be thrown away we didn't make it just to market it as a sustainable food product but also wanted to create something that new generations of consumers can enjoy the wine is available at sachi's online store at 30 for a 500ml bottle mr ng added that sinfootech is also producing bubble tea pearls using soya bean pulp at christmas dinners turkey and roast beef are a common sight but the impact of consuming them might not just be limited to your waistline according to the food and agriculture organisation an agency of the united nations each kilogram of beef results in the production of 300kg of co2 equivalent another player in the local food tech scene gaia foods is helping to reduce the festive footprint it is the first south east asian company to produce red meat by using stem cell technology the meat is grown in a nutrient rich environment with sample cells from the animal the company claims this process produces at least 80 per cent less emissions than current beef production methods gaia foods was acquired in august by local food tech company shiok meats which produces the world's first cell based crab meat it doesn't feel like christmas if you are not ripping into a nicely wrapped gift or unwrapping the plastic from hampers on the festive morning but pretty wrapping paper and one time use plastic packaging are worsening the issue of waste it would be ideal to forgo wrapping paper entirely or reuse newspapers or rough paper instead gifts can be placed in reusable bags at the same time sustainable and biodegradable packaging materials are on the rise for instance the hardy underground root network of mushroom called mycelium can be grown into organic waste such as leaves used coffee grounds or spent barley grains to form a fused mass using moulds the mass can be set into various solid shapes and used as packaging components to replace styrofoam for example local mycological design studio bewilder has been creating cube like protective corners using the mycelium based materials to replace styrofoam corners commonly used to protect electronic equipment like printers and laptops mycology is the study of fungi the mycelium based corners decompose in three weeks bewilder also shapes the fungi based materials into globes to replace foam peanuts recently researchers from nanyang technological university's food science and technology programme led by its director professor william chen created three types of paper like material by fermenting fruit waste and soya waste which is known as okara the fermentation process helps to concentrate the fibre and cellulose from the waste that become the main components of the paper the fruit waste includes durian rinds and fruit peels the paper like materials can be used as packaging materials including as boxes food containers and cups the ntu innovations have been licensed to a number of start ups and small and medium enterprises and are currently being commercialised said prof chen in the near future you may be holding a slice of log cake in a container made of durian husks or a glass ornament in a mycelium based casing celebrating christmas but hoping to do it in a more sustainable manner with waste output usually peaking in the november to february period according to waste management firm sembwaste here are tips to enjoy the festive season in greener ways it is the thought that counts not the price tag start your spring cleaning routine a couple of months earlier and besides unearthing good as new items that you have no use for you may even identify treasured possessions that a loved one would appreciate even more imbuing these gifts with sentimental value thrift shops and stores selling pre loved items offer another channel to help reduce the environmental impact of over consumption instead of scouring e commerce sites far and wide for gifts support local merchants not only will your money go to small businesses and creators but you will also reduce your carbon footprint of having these items shipped from overseas sometimes the best gift is the one you can't hold instead of buying a physical item that the person may not need giving an experience like tickets to an attraction or a workshop can be more enriching and also go towards curbing consumption overall for those who want to go one step further swiss start up climeworks is offering the world's most sustainable gift in the form of carbon offset gift certificates for 85 s 130 it

        "content": "singapore private security officers will see their wages go up annually over six years after proposals put forth by a tripartite committee on the security wage ladder were accepted by the government on friday nov 12 this will benefit about 40 000 security employees across 265 agencies in singapore the basic monthly wage for security officers who are lowest ranked on the ladder will more than double from 1 650 in 2023 to 3 530 by 2028 at the other end senior security supervisors will see their monthly wage increase from 2 240 to 4 430 over the same period overall the monthly gross wage across all job levels will rise at an average compound annual rate of 6 6 per cent from 2022 to 2028 under the progressive wage model pwm for singaporean and permanent resident workers this is more than twice the minimum 3 per cent annual increase announced in november 2017 under a previous set of recommendations the monthly gross wage is estimated based on a basic wage and 72 overtime hours the 3 per cent increase to baseline wages will still come into effect next year but the security tripartite cluster stc recommended a significant increase to the security officers' monthly wages in 2023 as well as a fixed dollar quantum annual increment from 2024 to 2028 the pwm for the private security industry was first announced by the stc in october 2014 it has been implemented as a licensing condition for private security agencies since september 2016 the stc said one of the aims of the latest review to the pwm is to address the manpower crunch faced by the private security industry ntuc assistant director general zainal sapari who chairs the stc said this shortage has been a perennial problem this is partly due to the fact that many service buyers are still relying on headcount based contracts this is exacerbated further by the fact that during this covid 19 period there are safe management measures by clients which the security agencies need to support coupled with new buildings coming up there is a shortage of security officers he said the latest recommendations can address some of the challenges faced by the industry mr zainal added the stc also noted the need for sustainable wage growth without excessive working hours it recommended that from 2024 onwards pwm baseline wages for security officers should include wages paid for work done in addition to the industry's 44 hour regular work week as an added measure to safeguard the security officers' welfare under the new wage schedule it also recommended that a maximum cap of 72 hours a month in extra hours be set above the 44 hour work week mr raj joshua thomas president of the security association singapore said it is difficult for the industry to attract and retain talent when officers are working 12 hour shifts six days a week at relatively low wages so the industry and security buyers must bite the bullet and there is an urgency to it we shouldn't look at security officers as a cheap resource said mr thomas but service buyers can temper this extra cost by reducing headcount and installing technology as well as engage consultants to get advice on how to deploy scarce manpower and technology effectively he added all this requires a mindset change amongst buyers and security agencies to embrace a very different security industry of the future mr thomas said the stc is also intensifying efforts to raise industry standards and improve the productivity of security officers through technology adoption and skills upgrading it called for service providers to invest in technology and explore job redesign or other ways to improve productivity and service outcomes security agencies can make use of available programmes and resources such as the productivity solutions grant or approach the union of security employees and security trade associations if they need help driving transformation efforts the stc noted meanwhile those in the security workforce should embrace upskilling and adopt a positive mindset towards learning new skills and work processes it added at the same time service buyers should adopt outcome based contracting and progressive procurement practices rather than headcount based contracting members of the public too should be civic minded and respect our front line security officers who are carrying out their duties to safeguard everyone's interests the stc urged the ministry of manpower and ministry of home affairs said in a joint statement on friday that the recommendations are timely and will augment tripartite efforts to uplift lower wage workers and transform the security industry government agencies will work closely with tripartite partners to implement the recommendations and create more meaningful

        "content": "singapore lower wage workers earning up to 2 000 gross monthly should get a pay hike of 70 to 90 or a 4 5 per cent to 7 5 per cent raise if it is higher to ensure that pay for such workers grow faster than those at the median wage level this guidance on the rate of progressive wage growth was outlined by the national wages council nwc on friday oct 29 in its guidelines that will apply from dec 1 this year to nov 30 next year at the same time the council said its recommendations for lower wage workers going forward will reference gross monthly wages and be relevant for employees earning up to 2 000 gross monthly which covers about one fifth of full time employed residents in singapore its previous recommendations were made with reference to workers' basic monthly wages this is in line with the tripartite workgroup on lower wage workers' recommendation set out in august that progressive wages for lower wage workers be expressed in terms of gross monthly wage instead of basic monthly wage to give employees greater certainty of the expected monthly wage for a set of standard working hours gross monthly wage refer to the sum of basic monthly wage overtime payments commissions allowances and other regular cash payments labour chief ng chee meng said in a facebook post on friday that having the guidelines apply to workers earning up to 2 000 gross monthly means more workers will be covered by these recommendations this is the first year that the nwc is making recommendations for the range of progressive wage growth for lower wage workers following recommendations by the tripartite workgroup which the government accepted this progressive wage growth range will be used to determine the wages for workers under the progressive wage model which covers lower wage workers in such sectors as cleaning and security since the start of covid19 our workers have responded with resilience strength and unity despite facing many in its guidelines the council said that employers which are doing well and have seen healthy revenue growth even during the covid 19 period should aim for the upper bound of the range while employers who are recovering or have recovered may aim for the lower to middle part of the range its recommendation takes into consideration various factors including the expected rate of wage growth in the medium term the current economic climate and the tripartite agreed pace to uplift lower wage workers so they can gain ground on the median worker the nwc also called on employers to provide a higher percentage wage increase for lower wage workers who are earning comparatively lower pay in line with the tripartite workgroup's recommendation to aim for higher wage growth for those who are lower paid the minimum dollar quantum of 70 to 90 also helps to ensure that the lowest paid employees receive a proportionately higher increase it noted recognising that some sectors or employers are still facing economic headwinds and are considering a continuation of wage freeze or further wage reduction the nwc set out a differentiated approach for such employers those freezing or continuing to freeze wages should consider a built in wage increase of up to 50 for lower wage workers while those implementing further wage reduction should freeze wages for such workers instead it said the council said that given this is its first year of implementing progressive wage growth recommendations and the need for lower wage workers to gain more ground with the median wage worker it will consider a higher range of progressive wage growth next year should the economic situation improve in a separate statement the ministry of manpower reiterated that the government too will do its part in uplifting lower wage workers through transitional support to help employers absorb part of the additional wage costs responding to the guidelines the singapore national employers federation snef said the recommendations are flexible enough for employers with varying business performance and outlook to implement while aiming to narrow the gap between lower wage workers' pay and the median wage level as many lower wage workers are in essential roles such as cleaners and security officers snef also urges service buyers and consumers to play their part in the whole of society effort to uplift the group by paying a reasonable price for better services it said commenting on the significance of the nwc's progressive wage growth recommendations permanent secretary for manpower aubeck kam noted that the tripartite workgroup's recommendations included leveraging the work pass system to ensure that firms which employ foreign workers have to pay progressive wages and the local qualifying salary to all local workers in the light of this the council's recommendation for progressive wage growth becomes a sort of pre condition for employers to hire foreign workers going forward he added join st's telegram

        "content": "singapore construction companies working on housing board projects have been thrown a lifeline to help lock in prices and supplies for some raw materials in a move by the government to ensure that construction progress remains on track and to minimise delays for home buyers measures include extending the duration of steel price protection provided by hdb for a total of nine additional months so that contractors do not have to worry about the fluctuation in steel prices said the ministry of national development mnd in a written parliamentary reply on monday sept 13 hdb will also provide additional supplies of concrete materials to contractors for local pre cast production going beyond the amount that contractors had earlier opted for in their tender said mnd this refers to cement sand and other aggregates previously steel price protection provided by hdb was for either 18 or 22 months typically covering the duration of structural works which are now taking longer to be completed due to the covid 19 situation with the nine month extension a contractor who started structural works in january 2020 can now be protected against fluctuations in steel prices until march 2022 the hdb said in a separate statement on wednesday that about 35 projects could benefit from this extension since january this year the prices of steel have risen by about 25 per cent and those of concreting materials by 15 per cent it noted hdb has also received feedback from the singapore contractors association that the quantities of steel ordered by contractors remain low due to the slower progress of construction works at the same time in the light of malaysia's movement control order mco contractors here are relocating their precast production back to singapore or switching to the cast in situ method of construction these contractors may have previously opted for a smaller quantity of concreting materials from hdb given that their precasters were overseas hdb noted but they may now require more materials which the hdb will provide them with and at the same price committed in the tender for contractors who wish to relocate some of their precast production back to singapore hdb will assist them in their application for land under a temporary occupation licence for the production and storage of the precast components contractors will be able to apply for additional supplies from october 2021 the move comes after the main contractors of five build to order bto projects went bust last month which caused around 2 900 buyers to face long delays for their homes the affected projects are sky vista bukit batok senja heights and senja ridges in bukit panjang marsiling grove in woodlands and west coast parkview in clementi the five projects are at various stages of completion with the two bukit panjang projects near completion said mnd the main contractors greatearth corporation and greatearth construction along with three other related companies are currently in the process of liquidation the construction industry has been one of the sectors worst hit by the covid 19 pandemic construction costs have risen with increased foreign manpower cost due to tightened border measures and increased raw materials costs companies have also racked up additional costs to adhere to safe management measures that are meant to curb the transmission of covid 19 on monday mnd said hdb is working with greatearth and their provisional liquidator pricewaterhousecoopers to bring onboard new contractors to take over and complete the five bto projects as soon as possible discussions are ongoing for the potential new main contractors and existing subcontractors to work together this will allow affected subcontractors the opportunity to work out a suitable arrangement to remain on the projects and complete the remaining works it will also minimise the extent of delays for flat buyers said mnd just before mid august on the feedback from a project consultant hdb had checked with greatearth and was informed that they had run into financial difficulties and were exploring options to continue with the projects slightly more than a week later greatearth informed hdb that they were unable to complete the five bto projects despite the government assistance provided to all construction firms over the past year prior to this work at the sites had been progressing satisfactorily and there were no signs of work slow down said mnd hdb had explored possible options to resolve greatearth's challenges such as providing advance payments to allow them to continue with the projects however greatearth did not have the financial ability to continue operations and made the decision to undergo liquidation said mnd home buyers of the five affected bto projects have not yet been informed of their revised completion date hdb said buyers will be informed when the replacement contractors have been appointed and the construction schedule worked out in june last year a 1 36 billion construction support package was announced to help construction companies co fund some of the extra costs they have to incur to comply with safe management measures at the worksites under the covid 19 temporary measures bill construction companies can also get reprieve from legal and enforcement action for their building and supply contracts although the relief period is set to end at the end of this month hdb said on wednesday that it has been releasing advance payments to contractors and has exercised flexibility in recovering the advance payments to help ease cash flow as at august a total of 170 million cash advances has been disbursed to 36 contractors for 74 residential projects under construction said hdb hdb has also helped co share the increase in non manpower related operating expenses such as the rental of equipment and site maintenance costs as well as co share the increase in foreign manpower salary costs given the severe strain that the construction industry is going through hdb said it will go some way to help contractors deal with the challenges and stand ready to provide more support where necessary the construction

responsibilities hwa chong international school reported a 100 per cent pass rate with an average score of 39 6 six students scored a perfect 45 and 51 7 per cent of the cohort attained scores of 40 and above acs international also recorded full passes with an average score of 39 17 nearly half of its 167 ib diploma students had scores of 40 or more and seven students attained perfect scores of 45 globally more than 16 800 students took the ib exams last november including nearly 6 300 students in the asia pacific region arif arman khan akhter ali khan 18 who studied theatre at sota and attained 40 points said the curriculum opened his eyes to social issues previously i always thought theatre was just about performance a form of escape or fun he said but sota exposed him to issues like racism and poverty and allowed him to explore how theatre could be a vehicle for social change for example a second year assignment was to build a performance based on a newspaper article his group chose the subject of domestic abuse we usually hear about domestic violence as a black and white issue but we wanted to show different perspectives from family members involved and the vulnerabilities in each character that lead them to this situation he said our message was that there are many factors that play a role in domestic abuse and we can look out for early warning signs before situations escalate other themes he has worked on in his performances include drug addiction among teenagers and the lives of refugees arif who hopes to read psychology at cardiff university hopes to study how people are inclined to feel and behave in certain ways i want to hopefully contribute to a more open conversation about mental health especially among the younger generation he said in a statement mr olli pekka heinonen director general of the ib said the last couple of years have been incredibly challenging for our students teachers and schools he said that ib students in singapore have shown resilience adaptability and commitment during the course of their examinations the ib is deeply grateful to educators who have supported our students along the way throughout their learner journey the dedication that singaporean teachers have shown is inspiring and i'm incredibly proud and honoured to see our nation's young people being guided by mentors that share the ib's mission of education for a better world he added due to disruptions caused by the covid 19 pandemic the ib had given schools assessment options for their students including written examinations if they could be administered safely and an alternative route using coursework and predicted grades the ib has ensured that student grades are fair valid and comparable irrespective of whether their

        "content": "eight mps posed additional questions about vaccinations and vaccination differentiated safe management measures vds for children in parliament on monday jan 10 here are edited excerpts of the key exchanges to what extent will the ministry of health moh allow parents to wait until non mrna vaccines are approved for their children's inoculation to give them more choice and to assuage their concerns about long term effects one such non mrna vaccine company novavax submitted data for approvals to singapore's pandemic special access route psar on nov 22 has novavax or any other non mrna vaccine maker submitted data for the authorisation for use for children above the age of 12 and if so when can these vaccines be expected to be introduced in the national vaccination programme the pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccine has gone through extensive clinical trials and during the clinical trials it was shown to be safe and effective specifically for myocarditis which is what most parents are concerned about in children there are about 8 5 million already vaccinated in the us and the incidence rate is about one in a million in the us you have to balance this against the downside of getting infection if infected chances of myocarditis is 450 in a million and there are also other effects such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome mis c which can make the child really sick on the question of novavax it is being assessed by the health sciences authority i think we need to let the scientists do their work and i think we should consider putting it into our national vaccination programme in the meantime omicron is upon us it is highly transmissible we do not want to rule out that even if a small percentage of children get very sick we might be looking at a significant number so i would suggest get your child vaccinated with an mrna vaccine given the circumstances i think it is the right thing to do now some young children may have undetected medical conditions and especially allergies if their parents do not send them for non mandatory medical reviews hence i wish to ask whether moh will advise all young children to undergo a medical review before going ahead with the covid 19 vaccination this is similar to how some adults with underlying medical conditions are advised to get clearance from a doctor in the early stages of the vaccination drive we took that approach in the early stages of the adult vaccination drive because at that time the amount of data that we had was less and the amount of experience that we had was less and now we know a lot more about both the disease as well as vaccination including in children so the approach for children is not so different from adults if they have an underlying condition and there's a risk the doctor will know about it but if the child is otherwise healthy then the recommendation is to proceed with vaccination the issue of allergies is slightly different in that for any drug you can't necessarily tell whether an allergy will happen or not happen on the basis of prior underlying conditions hence the team at the site of the vaccinations is trained to detect and deal with rare allergies that do happen so the short answer to the member's question whether all children have to go for a medical review prior to covid 19 vaccination is no boosters are shown to increase protection against infection and severe illness including omicron substantially is moh contemplating the imposition of a booster jab as a requirement for vaccinated travel lane travellers beyond the current requirement of two jabs only we do know that two doses doesn't last forever the european union has already implemented a guideline that is similar to ours nine months validity or 270 days so i think the world will converge towards some form of validity i believe and naturally this will become a requirement in due course that is my conjecture given what we know about covid 19 today over the last one to two years' worth of experience may i ask if the government will consider publishing the key quantitative and qualitative metrics and thresholds before decisions are made to actually change the safe management measures and i do understand the need to be nimble but having a decision making framework and matrix published would actually help businesses and consumers have greater confidence and clarity we don't want to be too rigid in setting parameters trigger points there's so many twists and turns in this pandemic we would rather be a bit more nimble and to be able to adapt but we take the member's point we want to strike a balance preserve the healthcare capacity and at the same time allow people to live life as normally as possible businesses to be able to operate and be able to survive and each time we make a decision we do explain show all the data hospitalisation icu intensive care unit and so forth to give a full rationale with numbers on why we decided that so i hope over time people begin to understand what are our key considerations even though we may not be able to pinpoint trigger points ultimately it's not about the numbers that cause all this uncertainty it's the fact that we're in the middle of a pandemic we were not entirely ready in the first year in terms of our resilience last year 2021 we are much better and i do believe 2022 will be even better hopefully this year we can ride through waves with a much more liberal posture that's how we keep on improving i received feedback from residents that some teachers have already practised vds measures in schools so can the education minister confirm that if teachers are practising that or any officers in the schools are practising that that is against government policy at the moment can i seek a clarification from mr leong for further information on which schools and what vds measures have which teachers been practising the resident who has given feedback to me is on my whatsapp message list can i refer to the messages and then i give a reply later thank you i would really appreciate if mr leong can give me the information of which teacher in which school has practised what vds measures so that we can take the feedback seriously and then look into the necessary follow up if possible at this point in time we have no plans to apply any vds in our schools we want as far as possible for our students to be able to participate in the core curriculum in the school activities for certain selected activities that may be deemed of a higher risk we may consider applying specific measures for them for example students participating in the playing of wind instruments or the choir or students participating in sports activities that may require close physical contact i also caveated my explanation by saying that of course we will look at the overall national posture for us to adjust our policies accordingly join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered

        "content": "singapore about 2 600 omicron infections have been imported into singapore so far transport minister s iswaran told parliament on monday jan 10 this is about 60 per cent of the 4 322 omicron infections recorded here so far the bulk of the imported cases were citizens permanent residents and long term pass holders returning home with short term travellers making up less than 10 per cent the key sources of the imported infections were the united states and britain which each contributed to 16 per cent of the cases and india which contributed to 11 per cent this broadly corresponds to traveller volumes on the 24 vaccinated travel lanes vtls launched here since september said mr iswaran it is also influenced by the incidence of omicron in these countries he added the three countries have experienced a surge in cases due to the new variant these infections come amid a significant increase in passenger traffic at changi airport over the past year from 3 per cent of pre covid 19 levels at the start of last year to 15 per cent at end december this was spurred by the launch of the vtls mr iswaran said addressing questions filed by mps on the reopening of borders measures to safeguard airport workers as well as the outlook for the aviation industry for the coming year he added barring unexpected setbacks like omicron we anticipate further recovery in 2022 as at dec 31 last year more than 220 000 travellers have entered singapore via air and land vtls less than 1 per cent were found to be positive for covid 19 based on their on arrival tests the minister said recent adjustments made to the vtl scheme were essential to balancing the need to manage the risk of importing omicron cases while also minimising disruption to travellers who had already made vtl bookings to enter singapore the authorities had to pump the brakes on these travel lanes due to omicron new ticket sales for vtl flights and buses arriving into singapore between dec 23 last year and jan 20 this year were frozen quotas for arrivals after jan 21 were halved and three planned vtls for qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates were deferred indefinitely as a precautionary measure however mr iswaran said singapore must press on with its efforts to restore connectivity with the world as part of learning to live with covid 19 and its variants the vtl scheme is a useful pathfinder for us to establish test and build confidence in safe reopening to vaccinated travellers ultimately we want to work towards quarantine free travel for all vaccinated travellers he said mr iswaran said singapore does not restrict any airline from applying to operate vtl flights and the overall quota of inbound vtl travellers is allocated to airlines based on the plans they submit to the civil aviation authority of singapore caas asked if more vtl flights will be allowed during festive periods the minister said the authorities will monitor demand for vtl flights and review quotas regularly while taking into consideration prevailing public health assessments mr saktiandi supaat bishan toa payoh grc asked about other countries vying for singapore's status as an aviation hub and the measures that can be taken to further increase passenger volumes at changi airport he cited a nikkei article last month which said that indonesia is seeking to challenge changi airport and kuala lumpur international airport as regional hubs via a 6 billion tie up with indian and french airport operators in response mr iswaran said changi is no stranger to competition there will continue to be new hubs that will emerge it is important that we mount a systemic response to preserve our competitiveness as an international aviation hub he said emerging from the covid 19 pandemic in a safe and robust manner is key to this mr iswaran added this is so that travellers airlines and the general population have the confidence that air travel can continue safely and that changi airport is one of the places they can travel through the minister added that the aviation sector has made a herculean effort to ensure safety in the past 12 to 18 months by inverting the operating model at the airport a civilian airport in general is designed for an experience for passengers to interact and we have had to reverse that logic and start doing segmentation testing and all kinds of other necessary protocols to protect travellers he said however these protocols while necessary also place a limit on how much passenger volumes at the airport can grow said mr iswaran we will have to work with our health authorities and the aviation partners to ascertain how much flexibility we have going forward and what are the possible rate limiting steps or aspects that we need to reconfigure so that we can go for the next round of growth based on both global projections and our own anticipation we should be able to do better this year but how much and how fast really is a function of the environment and we need to always prioritise the public health assessment ms foo mee har west coast grc asked whether the authorities would consider requiring those entering singapore via vtls to have taken a covid 19 booster jab in response health minister ong ye kung said it was his conjecture that booster shots will become a requirement for travel in due course noting how the european union has already

        "content": "singapore about a fifth of the 15 540 children aged below 12 who were infected with covid 19 last year had been in a hospital or covid 19 facility none of these 3 145 children remain hospitalised as at last saturday jan 8 said senior minister of state for health janil puthucheary in an update on monday in parliament he said that since mid october last year singapore has seen several serious cases of covid 19 in children with some requiring intensive care although fewer children have been seriously ill with covid 19 compared with adults there is still a risk of them becoming seriously ill or developing severe covid 19 complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis c said dr janil as at last friday about 123 000 children aged five to 11 have received at least one dose of the pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccine or booked their appointments since vaccination for younger children began last month dr janil said the ministry of health moh has not received any report of serious adverse events or myocarditis from vaccination in children in singapore as at last friday the ministry will continue to monitor the vaccination exercise closely he added on boosters he said there are currently no recommendations for children to get these shots if introduced moh will continue to ensure that families with children are able to access vaccination services in a convenient manner he said responding to mps on the covid 19 vaccine jab's potential side effects for children dr janil cited international data to show there have not been safety concerns thus far in the united states where about 8 7 million doses had been administered to children as at dec 19 most of the adverse events reported were not serious and no safety concerns had been raised dr janil said 2 4 per cent of the children who had reported adverse events experienced serious reactions such as fever vomiting seizures and myocarditis which is heart inflammation the incidence of myocarditis which is what many parents are most concerned about is about one in a million doses the children reported with myocarditis following vaccination had either recovered or were recovering at the time of the report he gave the assurance that all 15 designated paediatric vaccination centres are equipped with monitoring and resuscitation equipment and the medical personnel are trained to manage any on site emergencies arising from allergic reactions most side effects experienced by children after vaccination have been mild such as injection site pain fatigue and fever and would typically resolve in a few days he said currently only the pfizer biontech comirnaty covid 19 vaccine is authorised for use in children aged below 18 years special exemptions are made for those aged 12 to 17 who are not medically eligible for this vaccine to receive the sinovac coronavac vaccine dr janil said moh will work with the expert committee for covid 19 vaccination to review if this exemption can be extended to children aged five to 11 who are medically ineligible to complete the pfizer vaccine regimen as at last thursday less than 4 per cent of young people aged 12 to 19 or 14 097 individuals remain unvaccinated fourteen of them are medically ineligible for the pfizerbiontech comirnaty covid 19 vaccine in a supplementary question leader of the opposition pritam singh said that some parents may not be anti vaccination and have been fully vaccinated but are apprehensive about administering mrna vaccines to their children will moh allow such parents to wait until non mrna protein based vaccines are approved for their children s inoculation so as to give them more choice and to assuage their concerns he asked the aljunied grc mp also asked if singapore can expect the protein based novavax vaccine or any other non mrna vaccines to be authorised for the use of children above the age of 12 health minister ong ye kung said the novavax vaccine is currently being assessed by the health sciences authority i think we need to let the scientists do their work and i think we should consider putting it into our national vaccination programme we have always wanted a portfolio of mrna and non mrna vaccines he added but it will take time for novavax to be approved and there will be another set of processes to assess if it is suitable for children said mr ong in the face of omicron he advised parents to get their children vaccinated we do not want to rule out that even a small percentage of children can get very sick we might be looking at a significant absolute number he said but i think given the circumstances cost and benefit i think it is the right thing to do now to get your child vaccinated as quickly as possible join st's telegram channel here and get

choo were among parents who posted on facebook about their children starting primary school this year mr singh whose oldest daughter just entered primary 1 revealed that he was just like any parent in singapore who frets about how to give his child the best without overdoing it i dread overcompensating her educational journey the way many loving parents do and in doing so unwittingly boxing her as a reflection of myself and my educational journey he said he concluded that he would let his daughter learn experience and question and give her more exposure without resorting to crash courses or overloading her with enrichment classes meanwhile mr yip wrote about his son's grit taking pride that his fourth child had insisted on carrying his own school bag all the way to school can't say that of the other boys he remarked wryly for mr choo the trip with his daughter to ai tong school was both surreal and also a trip down memory lane he credited ai tong his alma mater with instilling in him values 36 years ago and said that he hopes his daughter too would find the first steps to her own dreams there p1 so the day has arrived as always too soon and too quickly i suppose they all grow up this fast my oldest 004 started primary school today gave him a hug before we left this one has grit he insisted on carrying his 36 years ago i started school at ai tong school today i got to send my

a photo of a recruit's schedule mr baey said that the lunch breaks were now 2 5 hours longer than they were in his time sent my son to ns saw that many others also chose to shave their hair off before enlistment during my time it was many of the young men had also chosen to shave their hair beforehand while those from his generation saw enlistment as time to get a free haircut he added it's a rite of passage for every singaporean man while i was not fit at all during my ns i still found the experience very meaningful and nurturing a new facebook profile picture for health minister ong ye kung sparked the online equivalent of catcalls from hundreds of netizens who commented on how great he looked one even compared him with a korean star speaker of parliament tan chuan jin also commented asking mr ong which photographer shot the picture for him with both politicians in fine shape netizens naturally started comparing their looks some joked that mr tan would look as handsome as mr ong if he was photographed by the same person and said mr ong would not want to help a rival but if mr tan was basking in the praise he was soon sent crashing back to earth with others telling him that

        "content": "cancer is the leading cause of death in singapore and the most common type that afflicts women is breast cancer with over 2 000 cases being diagnosed every year nearly 1 in 12 women in singapore will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime one in four women with the disease is at an advanced stage of it with 15 per cent presenting in stage 3 and 10 per cent in stage 4 according to dr chan ching wan a senior consultant and breast surgeon at solis breast care and surgery centre the rest of breast cancer patients at 75 per cent present with early stage disease she adds early detection of the disease offers a high chance of recovery for some patients whose conditions take a turn for the worse they may wonder if they will have to go for a mastectomy to surgically remove one or both their breasts or risk losing their lives but the fact is that it is no longer true that mastectomy is necessary to combat late stage breast cancer dr chan says patients presenting with late stage breast cancer all go for chemotherapy as first treatment half of those with stage 3 cancer may no longer need a mastectomy but the other half will still need it patients with stage 4 cancer do not routinely need surgery unless there are specific skin care problems there is only one type of mastectomy which is the removal of all breast tissue possible the procedure is normally needed when there are multiple areas in different regions of the breast with cancer or if the size of the cancer takes up at least 25 per cent of the size of the original breast as this does not allow for good re shaping of the remaining breast to maintain a reasonable contour and shape a mastectomy is also required if patients have other medical conditions that do not allow radiation to be safely performed a mastectomy is not always necessary if the cancer can be removed and there is still enough breast tissue remaining that can be reshaped to retain the normal shape of the breast although slightly smaller than before then breast conserving surgery can be performed says dr chan there are variations of mastectomy depending on breast reconstruction plans some considerations include whether all the skin and the nipple complex can be saved to perform a nipple sparing mastectomy or whether only the skin can be saved while sacrificing the nipple for a skin sparing mastectomy as with any surgery there is risk involved a nipple sparing mastectomy for instance requires the surgeon to remove as much breast tissue as possible in this case dr chan shares blood supply to the skin or nipple complex can be affected and the affected areas of skin or nipple complex can die leading to darkening of the areas and formation of a scab that will eventually fall off but these have minimal impact on the patient s health after the surgery although rare risky scenarios of significant bleeding or wound infections can occur a bad infection could lead to delayed treatment and also impact the appearance of the resultant scar from the surgery breast cancer patients considering mastectomy may have further treatment after the surgery and must be aware that the cancer may return surgery is only one part of cancer treatment chemotherapy and radiation therapy when necessary are equally important and play key roles to help control the cancer and minimise a chance of relapse while the mastectomy aims to remove as much breast tissue as possible there are usually small pockets that will remain therefore it is possible that breast cancer could return fortunately this is rare with good treatment and control says dr chan removing both breasts is not necessary unless the patient carries a genetic mutation it is advisable that patients below 45 years old should consider having genetic testing done to find out more before making a decision dr chan highlights three main things to bear in mind before opting for a mastectomy 1 quality of life post surgery the main issues are usually psychological especially when patients choose to forgo reconstruction and hence end up with a flat chest on the operated side this can lead to loss of self confidence depression and patients withdrawing socially from close family members and friends 2 recovery concerns physical recovery is usually smooth even in patients with other problems such as diabetes mental recovery is more challenging unless patients know what to expect and have had some mental preparation about how they will look 3 breast reconstruction immediate reconstruction is the recommended procedure today unless the patient s cancer is aggressive and carries a high risk of early relapse patients can choose to use their bodies natural tissues or artificial implants in breast reconstruction depending on their lifestyle or expectations another option is to treat excess skin on the breast as an implant depending on suitability however patients who qualify for this are few in number a mastectomy does not offer a cancer free guarantee and dr chan recommends that breast cancer patients seek medical advice on the next course of action additionally every woman should run self checks for all lumps in the breasts and go for regular screening after all early breast cancer detection can save breasts and lives make your mammogram appointment today at 6994 5477 or 8435 4167 whatsapp for more

making a surprise visit to mr pang's parents in melaka in what will be their first reunion since the covid 19 pandemic started my children were very excited they kept asking me if i had managed to buy the tickets said ms piang who has two daughters and one son aged between seven and 12 she is a singapore citizen while her husband is a malaysia citizen under the expanded land vtl scheme vaccinated singapore citizens can now enter malaysia via the causeway without serving quarantine the same arrangement goes for vaccinated malaysians entering singapore via the causeway previously only citizens permanent residents and long term pass holders of the country they are entering could travel via the land vtl according to the two bus operators under the vtl scheme transtar and causeway link they are now allowed to sell 50 per cent more tickets in line with the expanded scheme this means that up to 4 320 people can travel between singapore and johor daily without having to quarantine should all tickets be sold when the straits times visited the transtar bus station at woodlands temporary bus interchange and the causeway link station in queen street on monday morning long but orderly queues for the vtl buses were observed at both places most passengers were carrying folders with stacks of documentation as proof that they had met the various vtl requirements such as a negative covid 19 pre departure test there were solo travellers couples as well as those travelling with young children the immigration and checkpoints authority ica said that 679 persons were cleared for the land vtl arrival and 961 for departure as at 3pm on monday transtar travel managing director elson yap said that about 80 to 90 per cent of the passengers going into johor are non singaporeans singaporeans who have bought tickets to enter are mostly those who have family members there only a small number of people are going there for leisure he added on the demand for the tickets he said all additional tickets released on dec 17 for travel into johor have been sold out but only 20 per cent of the additional return tickets for monday have been sold likely due to people not returning to singapore yet singaporean travellers who spoke to the straits times said they were entering malaysia to visit their family members there mr awaluddin masnor 51 a papermaker said he was happy to be able to visit his family in johor for the first time since november last year his wife and four children are malaysians and live there this is the longest time that i have been separated from my family he said i had actually bought a vtl flight ticket to kuala lumpur today but i realised that travelling by the land vtl will be cheaper than the costs of the covid 19 swab tests required for air travel ms tan hui lin 44 is excited as she will get to see her parents in yong peng johor after being apart for over a year the process engineer said during the two weeks home she will also be helping to care for her father who had just undergone an operation she said my father is being discharged today i'm going to johor to take care of him he cannot walk right now so we will probably just order food from grab and have dinner at home ms tan believes that the expansion of the vtl will benefit many singaporeans and malaysians i think expanding the vtl is good for everyone one air vtl ticket is around 400 to 500 the land vtl is much cheaper than the air vtl so this means more people can afford to go back another traveller a teacher who only wanted to be named as ms sivaneswary 40 said she is returning to selangor to visit family she was with her husband also 40 and their daughter nine she was initially concerned about the trip given the severe flooding situation that is currently affecting parts of malaysia i was worried but we've spoken to our family members living there and they said the area is safe and unaffected she added that she had been waiting for the vtl to be expanded to include singaporeans going to malaysia but was uncertain if it would be implemented in time i was just scared that it would reopen very near to the reopening of school since the expansion

very close knit family and there are many of us when restrictions were tighter it was quite frustrating as we were not able to see them often said madam seah who lives with her husband on monday she had lunch at the food junction foodcourt in junction 8 in bishan with her two sisters in law and a niece who live near her and her husband up to five fully vaccinated people from different households can dine together at restaurants and eateries up from two previously it was part of covid 19 curbs that were relaxed from monday but madam seah is hoping restrictions could be eased further to allow eight to 10 people to dine together that way our family can meet again and we won't have to pick and choose who can join us for a meal and who can't said madam seah who has an extended family of more than 30 members she added that they used to frequently gather for birthday celebrations and chinese new year before the pandemic hotels and restaurants that the straits times spoke to said they received a higher volume of calls and e mails over the weekend after the multi ministry task force tackling the pandemic announced relaxed measures on saturday these were for new reservations and to modify existing reservations to accommodate bigger groups at regent singapore this was most apparent at italian restaurant basilico and the hotel's tea lounge which typically see larger groups we also saw a surge at cocktail bar manhattan where our guests are all adults and mostly from different households the easing of restrictions for them was long awaited said general manager oscar postma there was a similar spike in reservations at the ritz carlton millenia singapore especially at its all day eatery colony going into the festive season we are confident that reservations will continue to pick up as it has been a long time since a larger group of extended family and friends have been allowed to enjoy a meal together said mr stephen moroney the hotel's assistant director of food and beverage malls and eateries that the straits times visited in the heartland and central business district were generally quiet on monday just before and around lunchtime a number of diners were spotted in groups of three or four with only a handful of groups of five at malls namely junction 8 nex raffles city 313 somerset and ion orchard mrs linda tan 45 was spotted walking around raffles city with her seven year old daughter and three of her friends while deciding on a lunch venue we haven't seen each other for almost a year so when we heard the news on saturday we were really excited said mrs tan who is self employed my friends and i have been looking forward to meeting up for so long but we were holding it off because of the restrictions we also couldn't go to each other's homes as only two visitors were allowed she added restaurants and foodcourts that the straits times spoke to said they expect footfall to pick up at dinner time and over the weekend staff at food and beverage f b outlets were concerned about groups flouting the rules and intermingling now that the capacities for dining in have been increased we're understaffed right now so it will be harder for us to manage crowds said ms tan zhi yin 27 supervisor at tamago en an egg speciality restaurant located in 313 somerset with the five person dining in rule i anticipate people will start coming in groups of six seven eight and so on we have to split them up but they will demand to sit at tables next to each other said ms tan who added that in the past customers tried to move tables closer to their friends or family but others working at f b establishments said the new rules which no longer require them to verify people's addresses will save them time from nov 10 to nov 21 only fully vaccinated people from the same household were able to dine together in groups of up to five they had to prove that they all belonged to the same household via their identification cards or apps such as singpass or sgworkpass some eateries had to turn away groups which could not show proof that they were from the same household i'm happy about the new rules because it means more customers can come in and we save time by not having to check their addresses said mr yung fu 25 a supervisor at ya kun kaya toast at nex the outlet welcomed a few groups of four and five on monday morning others like madam lucia yeo 62 who conducts safeentry checks at junction 8's food junction is relieved that she will no longer have to check people's identity cards to verify their home address there was once i asked a patron for his identity card and he asked 'are you the police ' said madam yeo the new rules are good because some patrons have gotten frustrated when i checked their identity cards at about 7 30pm on monday there were many families of five spotted at heartland mall in kovan but there were just as many groups with three or four people at eateries such as saizeriya and sanook kitchen over at jem in jurong east lines had formed outside casual dining restaurants such as pepper lunch however diners were mostly in pairs with a handful of four patrons at a table from tuesday 11 hawker centres and

        "content": "after the un climate conference known as cop26 in glasgow scotland we expect to see continued high profile announcements of new electric vehicle adoption targets plans to phase out coal power as well as pioneering corporate environmental social and governance esg initiatives cop26 promises to unlock important insights on the role of financial markets infrastructure investment and development as well as future adaptations that will be necessary in the transition to net zero to shed some light on the current state of affairs across these varied but highly connected themes refinitiv has developed a by the numbers breakdown of the cross cutting issues that were discussed at cop26 among our major findings as the world continues to focus on the topic of sustainable investing data accuracy consistent disclosures and standardisation around esg reporting will be essential for investors the data shows a trend towards reduced global reliance on fossil fuels but persistent use of oil and gas raises questions about whether broad based climate goals are attainable a green crime global network of poachers illegal loggers and waste traffickers has created an extremely lucrative industry exploiting natural resources refinitiv s data driven approach to cop26 includes statistical insights on finance energy green crime and infrastructure investors now are much less likely to disregard esg risks or maintain that these are outside their fiduciary duties our data shows that 43 per cent of compliance and risk professionals indicate that the pandemic has increased the importance of esg factors for their companies esg investing has skyrocketed and esg funds have been outperforming non esg funds in seven of the last 10 years total assets under management in global esg related mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs reached a record us 4 7 trillion s 6 4 trillion in the second quarter of this year green bonds that are financing products specifically designed to support climate or environment related projects raised us 365 billion in the first three quarters of this year it is clear that accurate data is the bedrock of the esg challenge if investors are to assess the climate risk or opportunity of a particular asset they need climate related data that is complete and presented in a way that is comparable they require data that is comprehensive across all industries and countries whether it is data for investors or for companies listed in capital markets much like the trend in esg related investment vehicles renewable energy sources have become a topic of great investor interest and steadily increasing scrutiny the 12 month forward price to earnings ratio for global alternative or renewable energy companies is currently 32 4x current earnings that compares with a forward p e ratio of 11 9x for the traditional global oil and gas index while intense focus is on renewable sources research shows that industries such as maritime shipping are still relying on fossil fuels and the cost of co2 emissions continues to rise according to the refinitiv carbon market survey higher price expectations in key markets are making the cost of co2 a crucial factor in investment decisions the criminal exploitation of natural resources around the globe is estimated to be worth a startling us 256 billion annually the un and interpol cite wildlife crime as one of the world s top five most lucrative illicit activities here again data is central to addressing the challenge the criminal networks behind these environmental crimes often use legal business structures and complex business ownership models to obscure their illegal activity their ability to do this is often made easier by lax approaches to due diligence refinitiv research shows that 43 per cent of third parties are not subject to due diligence checks and 60 per cent of respondents are not fully monitoring third parties for ongoing risks cop26 delegates who are serious about finding a solution will be eager to use vast data sets and powerful analytics to root out green crime the trend driving sustainable infrastructure investment has the power to create an entirely new asset class and fix many of the root causes of climate change along the way major world economies and some of the largest institutional investors are reimagining utilities transportation networks and city centres as efficient sustainable resources this could be the precipice of a sustainability revolution according to projects tracked by refinitiv in 2020 alone us 272 billion was invested in sustainable infrastructure projects nearly double the levels seen a decade ago the largest growth has come from wind projects where us 55 3 billion was pumped in last year globally roughly 35 per cent of all new infrastructure projects announced last year were sustainable up from just 10 per cent a decade ago the stakes are high at cop26 literally life and

about 10 minutes the guard provided bandages with other park staff subsequently attending to mr spencer declining an offer to be taken to a hospital he headed to the nearby gleneagles hospital with his friend he was given tetanus shots and oral antibiotics and had some wounds stitched up before being discharged on the same day he has returned to the hospital three times to treat his wounds and has spent about 1 200 in medical bills he spoke to a representative from the singapore botanic gardens on friday dec 3 who told him that the authorities are investigating the incident mr spencer said he wants measures to be imposed to prevent a similar attack you got to keep the public away from the otters because this will happen again mr spencer who said he has difficulty sitting and is unable to sleep well now had earlier made plans to celebrate christmas with his family in britain but is uncertain whether he is well enough to travel dr tan puay yok group director of the singapore botanic gardens told the straits times that the national parks board which manages the gardens is aware of an otter bite incident there and is in contact with the victim he added that otter bites in the gardens and other parks are rare dr tan said visitors should observe wildlife from a safe distance and avoid feeding or approaching them especially when there are pups as the adults can be protective over their young the singapore botanic gardens' volunteers and staff monitor the movements of the otters and educate the public on the importance of observing them from a distance and not interacting with them he added signs with information on how the public can manage encounters have been placed throughout the gardens this is not the first time otter attacks have made headlines here shin min daily news reported in may this year that a 77 year old man was bitten in the leg in upper boon keng road near the kallang river a five year old girl was bitten at gardens by the bay in 2017 mr bernard seah a member of the otter working group believes mr spencer was attacked by a family of smooth coated otters called the zouk family that have frequently visited the singapore botanic gardens over the last few years mr seah who has been tracking movements of otters here since 2012 said the family which consist of nine adults and six pups are the most human tolerant otter family in singapore in my years of documenting otters' behaviours i have never heard of such an aggressive attack such attacks are not common and are likely to happen when the adult otters feel that the safety of their pups is threatened he added ms anbarasi boopal co chief executive of animal concerns research and education society agreed noting that otters are not typically aggressive she added that defensive behaviour is typical of other social wild animals such as wild pigs and macaques as singapore grows into a city in nature encounters with wild animals will soon become inevitable so the golden rule is really to keep a safe distance from the animals said ms boopal mr seah said otters cannot differentiate between a person trying to take a photograph of them and someone trying to attack them so it is always best to keep a distance he urged parents to keep watch on their children in parks and nature reserves and not allow them to run around unsupervised ms boopal noted that while it is important to put up warning signs in parks it boils down to the public's response otters and other wild animals cannot be trained so i encourage everyone to be mindful when coming across such wildlife always keep a safe distance and do not provoke them she said join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin

        "content": "singapore singapore's labour market improved in the third quarter of this year compared with the second quarter despite the continuing heightened covid 19 restrictions the manpower ministry mom said in advanced estimates released on friday oct 29 the number of retrenchments fell and total employment decline also slowed thanks to resident employment which covers singapore citizens and permanent residents growing faster sectors such as travel related ones are likely to start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with vaccinated travel lanes vtls opening up to more countries manpower minister tan see leng said this shows that our labour market stayed resilient despite the return to phase two heightened alert restrictions in july there continues to be many employment opportunities for our residents especially in outward oriented sectors such as professional services and financial services he told reporters on friday during a visit to deloitte consulting south east asia total employment excluding migrant domestic workers fell by 3 400 in the third quarter which was considerably gentler than the plunge of 16 300 in the second quarter the decline was due to non resident employment while resident employment grew more quickly instead but total employment growth remained k shaped in the third quarter with recovery remaining uneven across sectors mom noted outward oriented sectors such as professional services information and communications as well as financial services continued to see resident employment expansion the three growth sectors are expected to continue powering the economy and labour market for the rest of the year and into 2022 said national trades union congress assistant secretary general patrick tay in a facebook post with new and transformed jobs and opportunities created in this space and other areas including the gig space our challenge will be to overcome the structural mismatch of skills or expectations which causes structural unemployment as well as under employment on the other hand food and beverage f b services retail trade and accommodation trimmed their resident workforce this reflected ongoing covid 19 border restrictions and safe management measures imposed in the third quarter mom said with these non resident employment continued to contract across most sectors in the third quarter mom noted that with singapore's recent extension of its stabilisation phase till end november it expects the mixed employment trends observed in the third quarter to continue into the next quarter it added that sectors such as f b services and retail trade will continue to be affected as the extended covid 19 measures include group size curbs on dining in and other social activities the expansion of the vtl and travel related activities however may give an uplift to industries such as accommodation and air transport services mom said retrenchments a key indicator for the labour market are expected to remain low mom added there were 2 000 layoffs in the third quarter which is less than a quarter of the figure recorded during the peak of the pandemic last year the majority came from the services sector while 400 came from manufacturing and 100 from construction this was a decline from the 2 340 retrenchments seen in the previous quarter consequently we expect the incidence of retrenchment in the third quarter at a projected 1 1 retrenched per 1 000 employees to fall from the 1 3 registered in the second quarter mom said unemployment rates also fell although they remain elevated compared with pre pandemic levels last month resident unemployment rates stood at 3 5 per cent while overall unemployment rates were at 2 6 per cent this marks the second month of consecutive decline after the unemployment rates ticked up in july experts agreed that labour conditions continue to look promising in the coming quarters ocbc chief economist selena ling said i'm hopeful that the labour market should gradually improve further into the fourth quarter and 2022 retrenchments may decline but whether new hiring will continue to grow readily is another question maybank kim eng economist lee ju ye added that total employment should turn positive in the fourth quarter as singapore learns to live with endemic covid 19 and with the launch of vaccinated travel lanes this would provide some labour demand for consumer facing and tourism related services including f b services accommodation and recreation and culture although a return to pre pandemic levels remains a way off she said the easing of borders to allow migrant workers to return will be a much needed boost for sectors like construction ms lee added dr tan said it's encouraging that we continue to see our economy and labour market improving from the impact of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2021 however we should also expect that industries and job roles will transform at an accelerated pace and be prepared for these changes he commended deloitte consulting for helping with workforce transformation by partnering workforce singapore to run a career conversion programme for consultants to meet new manpower needs as businesses transform it is important that companies expand their hiring strategies to look beyond plug and play candidates he said more than 30 mid career workers have switched to consulting under this programme separately the firm has hired over 100 professionals since the start of the pandemic last year mr eugene ho deloitte consulting south east asia regional managing director said we continue to hire actively despite the covid 19 pandemic as the demand for consultancy services in the marketplace did not waver with many businesses looking for transformation solutions to survive and thrive he added that hiring a diverse mix of fresh graduates consultants and mid career switchers provides a workplace culture where different ideas can flourish join st's telegram channel here and

it noted on friday oct 22 the recommendations will be taken into consideration in the ongoing review of manpower policies the workplace fairness framework and employment support initiatives the remarks were in response to nine proposals put out by a pme task force led by the national trades union congress and singapore national employers federation to pinpoint better ways to assist professionals managers and executives pmes manpower minister tan see leng said in a facebook post on friday we share our tripartite partners' goals in strengthening workplace fairness and support for our pmes these recommendations are also timely as the government has rolled out several initiatives in recent months to support local workers including our pmes one of the key thrusts of the task force's recommendations is to enhance workplace fairness through improving human resources standards relooking the review process for employment pass applications and differentiating foreign worker access by occupations mom noted on friday that a tripartite committee had been formed in july to review the framework for workplace fairness the committee will study the recommendations put forth by the pme task force as it designs a legal framework that is balanced and in the best interests of singapore and singaporeans mom said it added that it regularly reviews work pass policies to ensure that foreign professionals complement the local pme workforce and help businesses create good jobs for singaporeans we have been exploring further refinements to the employment pass framework to achieve our objectives of a strong singaporean core complemented by a diverse foreign workforce it said the pme task force also made recommendations to support pmes in career progression and skills upgrading mom noted helping locals access opportunities has been the government's priority especially given the impact of covid 19 on the economy and labour market it added that the national jobs council has boosted job opportunities under the sgunited jobs and skills package the government also recently extended the jobs growth incentive which supports firms to expand hiring local jobseekers dr tan said even as employers embark on business and workforce transformation no worker should be left behind we will continue to work with our tripartite partners to ensure that our workers have the skills and be in the best position to meet the changing business needs experts agreed that the task force proposals will help pmes who face challenging times with the covid 19 pandemic coupled with the rapid pace of technological change adecco singapore country manager betul genc said age discrimination for one is a common challenge more and more pmes are increasingly facing stiff competition has been coming from the younger generations like the millennials who are increasingly rising up the corporate ladder and landing positions in junior management roles ms genc added that while workers know they need training employers must also provide the time off and support for it but the unemployment support might be tricky she said given the potential abuse of the measures if individuals choose to remain unemployed or delay their entry into the workforce ayp group managing director jolin nguyen said on top of training and relief provision the government could also offer initiatives such as job matching which could potentially be done through technology this would benefit the unemployed pmes as well as many companies that are still struggling to find the right talent firms also recognise that training workers is a win win solution ms susan cheong dbs talent acquisition group head said the bank is in the process of upskilling and reskilling 4 300 employees here in emerging areas such as design thinking data and analytics and machine learning the bank which has a representative on the pme task force said dbs is committed to grooming singaporean talent for leadership positions pmes themselves pointed to skills training as one of the most vital aspects of the recommendations procurement manager daniel tong 45 said structured job and skill plans can help him understand the required capabilities for a role and what a company needs from him mr philip kwa 59 who runs a training services business said training support and mentorship programmes will be very helpful to pmes like myself we need to keep ourselves relevant the short term support for firms hiring mature workers is also helpful in encouraging employers to consider older workers he said

income relief and assistance while an additional level could offer more support for union members and vulnerable mature workers this was among nine recommendations that the labour movement released on thursday oct 21 after a year long consultation exercise to pinpoint better ways to assist professionals managers and executives pmes the initiative which was carried out by a task force from the national trades union congress ntuc and singapore national employers federation snef involved consultations with around 10 000 workers and business leaders ntuc secretary general ng chee meng said pmes feel the pressure from foreign competition and for mature pmes they find it challenging to bounce back when they lose their jobs thus we must do more to level the playing field for our local pmes while enabling other forms of employment and employability related support like unemployment transition support job search or training support for them the task force also called for a tripartite work group to be set up to assess the feasibility conditions and size of the proposed unemployment support ntuc assistant secretary general patrick tay said more issues have to be studied such as when to give out unemployment support how much to give and for how long he added that a survey showed that 80 per cent of unemployed workers took six months to find a new job this move must also go together with active labour market policies he said such as requiring workers on unemployment support to participate in employability camps go for job interviews and show that they are actively trying to find work specifically there should be more help for pmes who are over 40 years old the task force added calling on the government to provide short term salary support of up to 50 per cent capped at 3 800 a month for six months for firms that hire such job seekers there should also be more fast track training programmes with certification to help them transition into new roles besides help for the unemployed the task force also made recommendations to strengthen the singaporean core in the workforce by reviewing the application process for employment pass holders for one thing foreign worker access should be differentiated by occupation such as those that have an ample supply of locals who have the required skills the task force said in its report the process could also use a point system that considers factors such as whether the employer has been hiring local workers and the diversity of nationalities within the firm this goes beyond the usual considerations of education qualification and salary companies should also facilitate skills transfer from foreign staff to local pmes it added the task force proposed improving human resources standards including having shared services for smaller firms and empowering the tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices to enhance workplace fairness by imposing tough penalties on errant companies snef president robert yap said providing support to strengthen the employability of local pmes is essential for employers to meet their manpower and skill demand through developing a strong singaporean core complemented by foreign manpower this will help employers to grow their business in and from singapore he added that the recommendations also aim to help local pmes develop deeper skills and gain overseas exposure so they can take on global roles for instance the task force proposed more funding for pmes to be groomed for leadership roles in multinational corporations and large local enterprises as well as incentives for firms to send local pmes for overseas opportunities more structured jobs and skills plans will also help them to upskill in line with industry requirements the report said the task force said that its consultation exercise found that pmes were most concerned about the lack of job security and required greater support in employment and training opportunities these issues also affect those in their 40s to 60s more acutely the snef and ntuc added even as businesses transform to ensure business sustainability the skill sets possessed by pmes including younger pmes may be at risk of becoming obsolete these are especially so as the singapore economy has been impacted by covid 19 they said mr ng said the government could consider its recommendations he hopes to get some clarity next year i think this is an important and urgent issue for the labour movement and ntuc wants to step in in the interest of our vulnerable pmes he said join st's telegram

coast parkview in clementi located opposite west coast park this serves as one of the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme sers replacement sites for residents in blocks 513 to 520 west coast road there are a total of 2 982 units in the five projects the two affected public projects are the mandai crematorium and columbarium under the national environment agency nea and the gali batu bus depot under the land transport authority on wednesday aug 25 hdb informed the affected home buyers that the main contractors two related companies called greatearth corporation and greatearth construction had run into financial difficulties and the projects would be further delayed hdb did not specify the length of the delay but said home buyers would be kept updated on the situation once new contractors have been appointed and the construction schedules worked out greatearth informed hdb last week that it was unable to complete the five bto projects under its management despite the government assistance provided hdb said in a statement on thursday hdb said it had explored possible options to resolve greatearth's challenges such as through advance payments but greatearth did not have the financial ability to continue operations since aug 20 all works at the five sites have stopped prior to this the progress of works was satisfactory and there was no sign of work slowdown or any sudden reduction of supplies or workers on site added hdb new contractors will be appointed as soon as possible to complete the remaining works said hdb contingency contractors will be brought in to secure the work sites and carry out housekeeping and mosquito control until new contractors are appointed the 230 unit senja ridges in bukit panjang was earlier slated to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year while the 552 unit senja heights was due to be completed in the first quarter of next year the 257 unit sky vista bukit batok was slated to be completed in the third quarter of next year the 1 246 unit marsiling grove in woodlands in the fourth quarter of next year and the 697 unit west coast parkview in the second quarter of 2023 the completion dates for these projects had already been pushed back because of manpower and supply disruptions in the construction sector caused by the covid 19 pandemic these delays will affect home buyers and disrupt their life plans and they will understandably be disappointed by this latest development hdb said in its statement hdb will do our utmost to bring the replacement contractor s on board as soon as possible to minimise the extent of any delays while ensuring that safety and quality are not compromised greatearth is a home grown company that has worked on more than 400 projects including the raffles town club mount elizabeth hospital and nanyang technological university's lee kong chian school of medicine campuses in boon lay and novena nea told the straits times that it expects the completion date of the new crematorium complex in mandai to be delayed given the change of main contractor it was originally set for the end of next year for the gali batu bus depot off woodlands road lta said it is currently in discussion with gamuda berhad singapore an engineering and construction company that was partnering greatearth on the project on how to ensure project continuity and minimise the impact on the completion timeline the bus depot which will be able to accommodate around 500 buses is currently around 15 per cent completed and is slated to be completed around 2024 greatearth has two other ongoing public projects bulim square and the infrastructure in jurong innovation district under jtc corporation both projects were joint ventures with other partners who have agreed to take over and fulfil the contract commitments said jtc at this juncture we do not foresee delays to the ongoing works resulting from greatearth's financial difficulties it added the news came as a shock to some home owners who are now fretting over the uncertainty of their flats mr roger etienne lee 49 who works in the education sector said he has now no choice but to stay put at his current three room flat at block 520 west coast road the block is part of the estate selected for sers in 2016 and the replacement two room flexi unit was supposed to be ready in the third quarter of next year however the disruptions caused by covid 19 have pushed the completion date to the second quarter of 2023 which will now be further delayed i had opted to downgrade my flat size so that i can pay off my bank loan earlier it's very frustrating because we don't know how we might be compensated mr lee said some of us who are still living in the old sers blocks have units in need of renovations but because the

launch buyers will also have to wait more than five years for these flats the longest wait in this launch as the project is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2027 hdb said the long waiting time is mainly due to additional preparation works required for the site as well as the design of the project one of the residential blocks in the project at 39 storeys high is taller than

        "content": "singapore my son turned five in the middle of last month it meant that besides growing another year older he would also be eligible for vaccination against covid 19 singapore approved the pfizer biontech vaccine for children aged five to 11 a few days before his birthday was i enthusiastic about the news not exactly my son was four for most of 2021 so i never had to consider the possibility of him getting a covid 19 jab and he would be among the youngest in singapore and the world to be vaccinated against the disease if we signed him up my husband and i are fully vaccinated he has also received his booster and i am waiting for mine but our initial reaction to the news was still apprehension why was the qualifying age five and not six does a five year old child's body and immune system work the same way as an 11 year old pre teen i was also concerned as my son has a lifelong medical condition known as primary bile acid synthesis disorder it is a rare genetic disorder that requires him to be on daily medication to supplement his body with cholic acid which it does not produce naturally so far the vaccine has been shown to be safe for young children and the united states centres for disease control and prevention cdc granted unanimous approval for the pfizer biontech vaccine to be given to kids aged five to 11 pfizer and biontech said their vaccine showed 90 7 per cent efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children aged five to 11 according to the us food and drug administration no serious side effects were detected among more than 3 000 children in the age group who received the vaccine common side effects included a sore arm fatigue headache fever and swollen lymph nodes these were generally mild to moderate and most went away within one or two days separately as at dec 30 the cdc has reported 11 cases of myocarditis an inflammatory heart condition among children aged five to 11 who got the vaccine the cases were mild and found among over eight million vaccine doses given at the time that the data was examined in singapore about 20 000 children have received their first dose since dec 27 the first day of the vaccination exercise for younger kids as at jan 2 more than 60 per cent of primary 4 to 6 pupils have registered for the vaccination children younger than that will get their jabs from early january the data looks good and many adults have had the vaccine themselves so why do some parents remain uneasy some feel the studies done so far are insufficient doctors say that there is no reason to believe that the jab has any effects on children's long term development but they also say only time will tell whether this is certain hence some parents are choosing to wait and see hoping that more data will be released soon i am curious to see the results of local trials like the one by kk women's and children's hospital which is conducting a study to assess the antibody levels and immune responses in children aged five to 11 who receive the vaccine i know of parents who worry that the covid 19 shot might interact with existing conditions their kids have such as allergies asthma or eczema some see the adverse reactions that happened among adolescents and adults and wonder if their child would be an outlier too even if the risk is extremely low others think that children are not exactly a high risk group in terms of covid 19 and wonder if the risks of potential unknown side effects in the long run outweigh the risk of covid 19 disease itself these sentiments are not unique to parents in singapore polls done overseas have shown that parents are a divided group and a proportion of them are undecided the chances of any adverse reactions to the vaccine are very low but we are no stranger to rare occurrences with my son's five in a million condition we wrote to his specialist doctor to ask if he would be medically eligible and she gave the green light still some fears may not be entirely rational i asked my husband last week what he felt about all these trains of thought something he said stuck with me in the end we are making the decision based on imperfect knowledge we will never know the answers to some questions no matter what the doctors or experts say we do not know for sure how all children will react to the jab as is the case for adults but we know that they too can contract covid 19 and singapore is seeing more children below 12 being infected in recent months even if their symptoms are mild they can also pass on an infection to vulnerable people like their grandparents we know that vaccination can prevent infection and transmission to a certain extent but by far the most important outcome of vaccination seems to be that it greatly reduces the odds of developing severe illness according to a national geographic article in november paediatric cardiologists agree that cardiac complications seen with multisystem inflammatory syndrome mis c as a result of a covid 19 infection are more serious than the myocarditis seen from the vaccine mis c is a condition where different body parts including the heart lungs kidney brain and eyes can become inflamed a handful of cases have been found here the doctors in the article said they had encountered more severe heart issues among kids and teens from covid 19 than from the vaccine we also know that singapore is preparing for a new wave of omicron cases and the mrna vaccines have been found to be effective in protecting against severe illness caused by this variant we also discovered that five is not a magic number but that children that age are eligible for the jab because the age group of five to 11 was used in the clinical trials the health and education ministries organised a webinar to address parents' questions about the vaccine last month december it drew some 700 participants who asked about the vaccine's safety among other topics more of such sessions can help to allay parents' fears and address their concerns instead of their instinctively being judged or dismissed as being overprotective ultimately the decision is for every family to make and it is understandable that normally decisive adults would hesitate to take the same risks for their children as for themselves given the lack of perfect knowledge no one wants his or her child to be exposed to harm for the same reason we will eventually sign our son up for vaccination in the year ahead having read a little on the risks and benefits and in the absence of more data to show why we should not do so we have seen how covid 19 cases in his childcare centre have disrupted learning now and then and we would like for him to be better protected so that he also does not bring home the virus this is important to us as we live with my parents who are in their 60s and 70s we also do not want our younger eight month old daughter to fall sick and be hospitalised while it may seem like a logical decision for some it is not one that we made easily we make decisions for our children regularly and this was not one that could be taken lightly get the st smart parenting

        "content": "singapore the year ahead will be a time of transition as the economy is recovering steadily after two years of the covid 19 pandemic said prime minister lee hsien loong in his new year address on friday dec 31 he also gave a hint that the upcoming increase in the goods and services gst tax will be tackled in budget 2022 which will be unveiled on feb 18 pm lee noted that singapore needs a vibrant economy to generate the resources to realise its goals and the government must have reliable and adequate revenues to carry out its social programmes it needs to raise additional revenues to fund the expansion of our healthcare system and support schemes for older singaporeans those who are better off should contribute a larger share but everyone needs to shoulder at least a small part of the burden he said this is the rationale for raising a broad based tax like the gst coupled with a comprehensive scheme of offsets to cushion the impact on lower income households he said the gst forms one important component of our system of taxes and transfers that also includes income and wealth taxes overall our system will remain progressive and fair he noted that this need had been seen coming for some years now that our economy is emerging from covid 19 we have to start moving on this budget 2022 will therefore lay the basis for sound and sustainable government finances for the next stage of singapore's development first announced in 2018 the increase in gst from 7 per cent to 9 per cent is meant to help singapore meet rising recurrent spending needs especially in healthcare and social support a 6 billion assurance package has been set aside to help cushion the impact of the hike and enhancements to the existing gst voucher scheme are also forthcoming the government has said previously that the planned gst hike would take place between 2022 and 2025 and sooner rather than later taking into consideration overall economic conditions in his new year address pm lee said that the singapore economy is expected to grow by 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 2022 while the omicron variant has brought new uncertainties the country is in a stronger position compared with two years ago thanks to the roll out of the vaccination and booster programme this has allowed better management of public health challenges while minimising the hit on the economy singapore will safely expand cross border travel and press on to bring in much needed migrant workers as well as international talents who can complement singaporeans he said in the longer term singapore must also continue to seek out new growth areas and create new jobs such as through pursuing trade liberalisation via the regional comprehensive economic partnership which comes into force on jan 1 2022 much of this will depend on a stable global and regional environment central to which is relations between the united states and china he noted while differences between the two powers remain deep their recent high level engagements are encouraging he added looking back on the past two years pm lee said the pandemic has been a crucible of fire for this generation of singaporeans we continued our long and hard fight against covid 19 in 2021 we stood together supported difficult decisions made he noted that singapore has had to take drastic measures to protect lives and livelihoods closing the borders for the first time in the country's history and also drawing heavily on its past reserves as a result the country has been able to protect its healthcare system and prevent significant loss of lives at the same time helping the economy recover from the worst ever global downturn he said at every step of the way singaporeans mustered strength and resolve to support one another many went above and beyond the call of duty he added it has shown us the crucial importance of standing united as one this will not be the last crisis to try us we will face more tests and trials in our nation building journey he called on singaporeans to strenuously resist powerful external tidal pulls that will strain societal fault lines and to maintain the core values that make them singaporean even as societal norms evolve with successive cohorts coming of age this requires us to keep up efforts to strengthen our social consensus and shared identity we must continue forging trust and mutual understanding both between the government and the people and among singaporeans of all backgrounds he said describing this as a crucial task that cannot be neglected even amid the pandemic pm lee cited how singapore had moved to change the rules so muslim nurses in public hospitals can wear their headscarf and it is also in the process of enacting an anti discrimination law for the workplace among other things going forward the government will strive to solidify the social compact to build a fairer more inclusive and united singapore he said it will do so by mending rifts deepened by the pandemic helping those who have fallen behind enhancing safety nets for the vulnerable caring for people's mental health as well as meeting the needs of an ageing society he added observing how singaporeans had supported difficult decisions and also made many sacrifices throughout the pandemic pm lee said we can confidently say that we have measured up as one people in a crisis everyone saw the need to make tough choices and accepted hard policies for the common good looking ahead confronted with longer term challenges we must maintain the same unity of purpose fortitude of spirit and willingness to accept difficult measures in order to overcome them decisively and keep on progressing together this is how we will build a singapore where everyone has

        "content": "singapore workers party chief pritam singh never used the words take ownership and responsibility during their oct 3 meeting ms raeesah khan told a parliamentary committee on wednesday dec 22 mr singh had instead asked her to stick with her narrative rather than come clean on the untruth she told in parliament on aug 3 ms khan added the former wp mp gave this testimony during her third appearance before the committee of privileges as she answered questions about an oct 3 meeting she had with mr singh sticking to what she told the committee on dec 2 and 3 ms khan refuted claims by mr singh that he had expected her to set the record straight in parliament and had made this clear to her by oct 3 during the one hour hearing on wednesday ms khan also said repeatedly that she was telling the truth and that she will not lie under oath ms khan's conduct is under scrutiny by the committee after she told a lie in parliament during a speech on aug 3 about having accompanied a sexual assault victim to the police station ms khan had claimed that the woman had been driven to tears by the insensitive questions of the police but on nov 1 she admitted that she had heard the anecdote in a support group she was part of as a survivor of sexual assault herself during hearings before the committee she said she had confessed the lie to her party leaders by aug 8 and had been told by them to continue with it she also said that at an oct 3 meeting mr singh had told her that he would not judge her if she kept to the narrative mr singh has denied saying this he told the committee on dec 10 that when he met ms khan on oct 3 he had told her that he expected her to take ownership and responsibility of the matter and this meant that she was expected to tell the truth mr singh said ms khan became uncomfortable upon hearing this so he said i will not judge you which meant i will not judge you if you take responsibility and ownership asked about mr singh's testimony ms khan said this is the first time i've heard him say these words she added that her former party leader did not give any directive to clarify the lie in parliament she said he said that if i were to continue the narrative he would not judge me mr singh had earlier testified to the committee that he was shocked ms khan had claimed that no one else was present when they had the oct 3 conversation because her whole family were at home that night asked about this by the committee ms khan said that what she meant in her earlier testimony was that no one else was present at the conversation between her and mr singh as they were seated in a corner of her home she confirmed that her parents husband and her brother were at home during that time she took issue with mr singh's suggestion that she was uncomfortable with their conversation that night saying i was never uncomfortable i was in my own home after their conversation on oct 3 ms khan would go on to lie in parliament again on oct 4 when questioned about the anecdote by home affairs and law minister k shanmugam during her exchange with mr shanmugam she had texted mr singh to ask him what she should do when mr singh was asked about this text message by the committee he had said that there could have been no doubt that he expected her to set things right but ms khan told the committee on wednesday that she had texted mr singh because she was unsure of what to do i thought that he would say just continue because that was the conversation that we had the night before she said when he did not reply to her text message she went ahead to continue lying as they had discussed she added that night ms khan met mr singh and wp chairman sylvia lim at mr singh's office in parliament house mr singh and ms lim had both told the committee that ms khan said during this meeting that perhaps there was another path to tell the truth explaining what she meant she said on wednesday i was hoping for a clear directive to either tell the truth or to continue with the lie in response to ms khan s suggestion mr singh testified that he said rather angrily during the oct 4 meeting that ms khan had chosen her path by lying again that day ms khan told the committee on wednesday that she did not respond to this statement that night as she was shocked given the conversation on oct 3 during which there was no intention or directive from his part to tell the truth mr singh and ms lim had also given evidence describing ms khan as distraught and in tears during the oct 4 meeting but she denied this saying that while she was stressed she was not crying she also took issue with mr singh's characterisation of her state of mind he's trying to paint this picture of me as being emotionally or mentally unstable which again i think is completely out of line and hopefully there's a testimony that i'm of sound mind on wednesday ms khan was also asked about a nov 29 meeting she had with the wp's disciplinary panel set up to look into her conduct after she admitted to her lie in parliament on nov 1 ms lim s notes from the meeting indicated that mr singh had told ms khan before oct session i met you i told you it was your call mr singh said he did not use those words on oct 3 but had told her she had to take responsibility for her lie ms khan confirmed that the words in ms lim s notes were what mr singh said to her on nov 29 but she added that mr singh never presented her with a choice on oct 3 but had instead told her that if she continued with her narrative he would not judge her he did not put it forth as saying you can either tell the truth or you can continue with the lie she said see the full report released by the committee of privileges watch the video of the hearing

        "content": "singapore healthcare institutions already facing a manpower shortage are on standby to activate staff volunteers and other support staff should the omicron covid 19 variant spark a wave of severe cases the government has warned that an omicron wave is imminent while the latest variant is believed to cause a milder disease than the delta variant the hospitals here are closely monitoring the situation the national healthcare group nhg for one has been tapping administration staff who are cross trained to support manpower on the front lines where appropriate its healthcare institutions also leverage sg healthcare corps a medical reserve force that the government set up in 2020 to gather volunteers to fight the coronavirus as well as part time staff to augment manpower needs said nhg's group chief human resource officer olivia tay the national university health system nuhs is prepared to convert existing hospital wards for covid 19 patients if needed and has staff volunteers on standby to support its front line staff should there be another surge in cases a spokesman said such staff volunteers had helped with basic tasks such as serving meals clearing food trays and keeping watch on patients with a high risk of falls in the fourth quarter of last year after covid 19 hospitalisations here went through the roof from around late september to november these staff volunteers are no longer deployed at the wards the spokesman said manpower shortages continue to be a major issue at healthcare institutions impacted by the great resignation the 2021 global phenomenon describing the mass exodus of workers which left the organisations with no choice but to find new ways to cope in november last year senior minister of state for health janil puthucheary informed parliament that about 1 500 healthcare workers had resigned in the first half of 2021 compared with about 2 000 annually pre pandemic that number for the first six months of 2021 included nearly 500 foreign doctors and nurses staffing shortages at many healthcare institutions around the world have led to burnout driving many workers to quit their jobs at nhg attrition across the cluster and of its nurses in the first year of the pandemic was manageable said mrs tay who added however 2021 saw an increase in attrition rates which were higher than the pre covid periods to augment manpower the group is working with moh holdings mohh to expand and diversify its recruitment options she said we have also been actively offering structured career programmes to displaced workers from other sectors last year was challenging as the delta variant's arrival in april created a new wave of cases with many countries facing rising covid 19 cases in the hospitals the demand for healthcare workers has remained high hiring is challenging there is a higher demand for healthcare workers than what the market can supply overseas recruitment is also challenging due to uncertainty caused by stringent border measures said mrs tay we are in need of all types of healthcare workers from medical to ancillary staff our greatest challenge at this juncture is attracting more healthcare assistants and patient service associates to public healthcare she added referring to roles that help lessen the load of nurses we have leveraged on job redesign and conversion programmes to attract job seekers especially singaporeans and permanent residents this tight labour situation is not expected to improve until singapore transits from a pandemic to an endemic stage where the workload is more predictable and manageable said mrs tay nuhs is looking to fill administration and support positions as well as nursing vacancies its group chief human resource officer priscilla teo said the healthcare cluster has been participating in many career fairs or talks to support its recruitment needs we share and publicise our job or sponsorship opportunities regularly with students and alumni of the various schools and tertiary institutions for example there will be open houses this month by alexandra hospital ng teng fong general hospital and national university hospital to recruit multiple healthcare roles she said we also continue to leverage on job advertisements open house career fairs talks career conversion and return to nursing programmes nuhs is also banking on staff referrals collaborating with targeted associations and recruitment agencies to attract career switchers and offering more scholarships sponsorships and industrial attachment opportunities at singhealth singapore's largest healthcare cluster recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals have become a lot more challenging in this pandemic said its group chief human resource officer esther tan in addition to our direct hiring efforts both locally and internationally for healthcare professionals we continue to leverage existing initiatives such as bringing in mid career joiners under the professional conversion programmes for healthcare professionals and attracting non practising nurses to rejoin the workforce she said much of singhealth's retention efforts focus on supporting staff in their professional growth and development said ms tan we have also stepped up on our efforts to appreciate our staff and ensure that they are well cared for and provide

italian embassy in singapore said on wednesday that its health ministry has moved singapore and brunei to a list of countries deemed to be of higher risk of covid 19 infections travellers from countries on the list may enter italy only for work health or study reasons out of absolute urgency or to return to their homes tourists however are banned exemptions may be granted in specific cases such as if the tourist is a citizen of a european union member state or has a partner staying in italy the embassy said that those who are still allowed to enter italy must self isolate for 10 days at a declared address travellers from singapore will still be able to transit through italy's airports to other destinations provided they do not exit designated areas within the airports these restrictions will stay in place from thursday till jan 31 next year the embassy did not specify italy's reasons for changing singapore's covid 19 risk classification mr mario vattani italy s ambassador to singapore disagreed with italy s move in comments published on the embassy's website he reportedly told news agency adnkronos it s a mistake here in singapore cases are now at a minimum level almost 100 per cent of the population is vaccinated i want to believe that the tougher travel restrictions on singapore are the result of a clerical error or a typo he also noted that the omicron covid 19 variant is practically absent in singapore repeated attempts by the straits times to contact the embassy were unsuccessful flag carrier singapore airlines sia said it will contact

event joins two others this week milken institute asia summit and bloomberg new economy forum among pilot events in a scheme that allows for large business gatherings with fully vaccinated attendees who have been tested for covid 19 around 300 international business and government leaders attended the ongoing bloomberg forum on wednesday while the milken summit which ended on tuesday saw networking zones of up to 200 people unlike the other two events however no pre event testing is required for restaurant asia 2021 the straits times understands that all the participants are locally based individuals including non singapore citizens who are fully vaccinated the f b event which returns after an almost two year hiatus will run till saturday enhanced safety measures include the pre registration of all participants and limits on the time they can spend in one of five zones around 500 participants are allowed for each of the morning and afternoon sessions and the event space is disinfected between sessions at the opening ceremony mr andrew kwan president of restaurant association of singapore ras called for an increase of dining capacity to eight people to help the battered f b industry get back on its feet i must make this one respectful request that it is perhaps timely to tap not on the brakes but the accelerator to increase the momentum of recovery with eight people dining for all who are vaccinated and who are medically excused he said ras and our members will pledge as an industry to do our part to screen and to serve our patrons safely and responsibly currently the group size limit for dining in f b outlets is two fully vaccinated individuals or five fully inoculated people from the same household with the f b sector in recovery mode the event's guest of honour minister for trade and industry gan kim yong announced the launch of a guidebook for entrepreneurs each year we see one in five f b outlets being replaced and one in two f b businesses does not make it past the four year mark even as more entrants enter the sector he said noting that f b sector is a challenging one it is thus imperative for new entrepreneurs to plan carefully before starting on their f b journey he added called turning passion into profits the book by ras and enterprise singapore contains key elements for long term success tips on menu engineering and financial management and advice from seasoned operators a copy can be downloaded from the ras and enterprise singapore websites restaurant asia which is co organised with the international coffee tea asia symposium will see 113 exhibitors and brands from 12 countries showcasing machinery equipment and ingredients the organiser conference exhibition management services cems is also expecting to host

2021 and singapore international jewellery expo 2021 mr edward liu managing director of cems told st that it is expecting similar if not higher numbers for the upcoming events in normal years our shows would have been four to five times bigger and we would have had over 200 exhibitors and we could even reach 5 000 to 10 000 trade visitors he said with restaurant asia 2021 we are testing the limits of how we can manage this with the safe management protocols in place singapore has always been the hub for the mice industry in this part of the world so any baby steps towards the total revival would be good for the singapore economy he added f b players st spoke to welcomed the arrival of large scale mice events such as restaurant asia and the bloomberg forum all these things are a signal that things can normalise and it's a sign that more things should be allowed to open up said mr loh lik peng chief executive officer of hospitality group unlisted collection however a lot more needs to be done before the f b scene can confidently say it is on the path to recovery he said as f b operators we are still under a lot of pressure with factors like inflation as well as food and labour costs added mr loh whose company runs brands like contemporary chinese restaurant majestic in the central business district and barbecue restaurant meatsmith which has outlets in telok ayer and little india we don't mind continuing things like vaccination checks as more of the population gets vaccinated and people have started to get booster shots but major milestones we're looking forward to are things like the current 10 30pm limit on alcohol sales and consumption being lifted as well as the limits on the number of diners allowed to dine in like him other f b operators are also hoping for news that restrictions on dining in capacities will be eased ahead of the lucrative festive period it will be good to know soon if eateries can allow five or eight people to dine in soon because we need to start planning for christmas and new year's the festive season is the time when restaurants can make money said ms joy chen business partner of seafood restaurant holycrab increasing capacities will come with rule changes hence ms chen suggested that f b groups should be consulted in focus groups before every round of new measures is rolled out by the authorities there are a lot of mixed signals each time and all the confusion can be worked out if we are consulted first she said mr keith chua executive chairman of abr holdings limited which runs restaurant chains like swensen's also asked that consumers be understanding there will be changes in regulations as we open up so we seek their understanding as new guidelines come out each time he said as operators look to bounce back they will also need the cooperation of landlords as partners in recovery the area of food delivery will also be quite a key part of the revenue structure for restaurants but delivery platform costs remain high so we need to work with them to find win win solutions he added last month a thousand spectators were present at the singapore premier league match where lion city sailors

        "content": "singapore a house or building made of mushrooms may sound far fetched and fragile but do not underestimate the strength of the mycelium a hardy component of the fungi researchers in singapore and switzerland are now studying the use of mycelium as a sustainable building construction material mycelium is the vast underground root network of fungi the mushroom one sees is merely the fruiting body making up just a small part of the fungus this means the bulk of a fungus grows underground in a 2019 documentary titled fantastic fungi it was reported that there are 480km of mycelium under every footstep one takes in the forest when cultured in the lab a mass of mycelium looks like white fluff although delicate looking this fluff is being turned into mushroom bricks for construction as part of a research project the branching threads are made of substances such as chitin and cellulose that are known to be strong said assistant professor hortense le ferrand a co investigator in the project under the future cities lab fcl global programme the programme was launched late last year at the singapore eth centre a collaborative research centre between singapore institutions and swiss university eth zurich the research on using mycelium for building construction is one of eight projects in the programme focusing on enhancing the sustainability of cities and human settlements buildings and construction generate about 40 per cent of planet warming carbon dioxide according to the 2019 global status report for buildings and construction a quarter of the emissions came from manufacturing building materials and products such as glass cement and steel between 2016 and 2019 construction and demolition generated the largest amount of waste in singapore between 1 4 million and 1 6 million tonnes a year although 99 per cent of the waste is recycled here this is where mycelium comes in handy mycelium cannot turn into an eco friendly building block on its own it needs plant based waste or food waste such as sawdust bamboo or coffee grounds as a medium when a fungus is grown on a bed of sawdust or corn stalks the mycelium branches out and snakes through the fragments of waste binding to them it takes three to four weeks for the mycelium network to grow and bond with every fragment of waste the mass is then cast into a mould to be shaped into a mushroom brick once the material has lived through its lifespan it can be composted instead of filling up landfills the mushroom brick has been around for a few years mainly showcased in installations now the researchers want to optimise the use of mycelium for building construction mycelium's growth depends on factors including the species of fungi type of plant based waste temperature and humidity said prof le ferrand at a virtual presentation hosted by fcl global earlier this month different species of fungi produce mycelium with different qualities studying the amount of chitin and cellulose that fungi produce is one way to find out which species and growth conditions yield the strongest mycelium said prof le ferrand who is a faculty member at nanyang technological university's school of materials science and engineering over the next five years prof le ferrand and her team will conduct studies to optimise the growth of mycelium and explore how 3d printing can be used to build a mycelium based structure the project's team in eth zurich is improving on the mushroom brick's function and exploring suitable architectural applications dr juney lee a senior researcher at the swiss institute and another co investigator of the project said at the presentation these alternative and sustainable materials tend to be much weaker than concrete or steel so they require an intelligent geometry and structural shape scientists from singapore and switzerland have recently embarked on a five year research project to find out how a hardy component in fungi known as mycelium can be used in construction here are some details on the process mycelium is the underground root network of a mushroom with threads that are measured in kilometres under an electron microscope mycelium threads branch out to form an intricate interconnected web a mass of mycelium has more networks than the number of neural pathways in a brain mycelium is rich in substances such as cellulose and chitin which are known to be mechanically strong it is also re resistant lightweight and absorbs sound when a fungus or mushroom grows on plant based waste such as sawdust or corn stalks the fast growing mycelium threads will bind the loose waste materials together into a mass forming the building blocks of a mushroom brick mycelium is organic and biodegradable once a structure or furniture made of mycelium and agricultural waste has ended its lifespan the material can be composted this means the renewable building block can return to the earth instead of taking up space in landfills in addition mycelium does not need to grow on soil it can grow within agricultural waste such as used coffee grounds leaves and bamboo fragments including food waste the threads also do not need to compete for land with food crops as a fungus grows on the waste the mycelium net gets thicker and acts like a natural glue to fuse the loose materials together mycelium secretes proteins that allow the threads to bind with the fragments this process takes three to four weeks of growth for the web to hold everything together factors affecting mycelium growth include the size and type of agricultural waste temperature humidity amount of light and water and species of fungus the mycelium based mass goes into a mould to be shaped into a building block to form the bricks the bricks will then be heated or baked to stop the mycelium from continuing to grow building materials made of mycelium or other sustainable materials are much weaker than conventional concrete or steel mushroom bricks are weak in tension therefore structures made of mycelium based blocks need intelligent structural shapes to make them stable mushroom bricks can be put through a process of compressing to increase their density and their compressive strength mycelium based materials can also be used as floor tiles and acoustic panels join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news

        "content": "singapore the new coronavirus variant omicron has put the world in a state of high alert but two experts the straits times spoke to on saturday nov 27 say more information is needed to determine if current pandemic protocols should change for instance it is not yet clear if current vaccines can protect a person from falling ill after being infected by the omicron variant said professor teo yik ying dean of the saw swee hock school of public health at the national university of singapore other things to monitor would be how fast the new variant spreads and whether those infected would suffer a more severe form of covid 19 prof teo said if the variant increases transmissibility but does not increase the risk of disease and death beyond what is already observed in the delta variant then the impact on the healthcare system is not that large if countries are able to ensure a high uptake of vaccination and vaccine boosters but he added that if there is clear evidence that omicron increases the risk of disease and death even for the vaccinated then countries will need to review the relevance of endemic covid 19 strategies at the moment it is still too early to determine whether the outlook is going to be pessimistic or optimistic he said professor hsu li yang who is vice dean of global health and programme leader of infectious diseases at the saw swee hock school of public health said the worst case scenario is that the omicron variant is more transmissible than the delta variant and that it can also completely evade the immune response triggered by past infection or vaccination if this happens singapore would have to abandon its approach to treating covid 19 as an endemic disease until new vaccines become available he added but i think this scenario is very unlikely given that it is not a completely new virus the new variant was first identified in gauteng a province of south africa and the world health organisation who was alerted on wednesday nov 24 it was declared a variant of concern by the who on friday nov 26 because of the large number of mutations detected in its spike protein which may cause an increased risk of reinfection among other negative effects the spike protein is what the coronavirus uses to begin infecting human cells it is the fifth variant of concern that has emerged since the pandemic first gripped the world almost two years ago the highly transmissible delta variant was declared a variant of concern in 2021 to curb omicron infections nations around the world have moved quickly to stop global transmission of the variant ceasing flights from many countries in the continent on friday nov 26 singapore's ministry of health announced that all travellers with recent travel history to seven countries in africa including south africa namibia and zimbabwe will be barred from entering singapore from 11 59pm on saturday nov 27 of the 27 countries that the republic has quarantine free travel schemes with britain germany and italy have detected the omicron variant asked if the variant could affect these vaccinated travel lanes vtls prof teo said it depends on factors such as the virus' incubation period which refers to the number of days between when a person is infected and when symptoms start to show and the length of the infectious period he explained this will help to determine whether the existing testing requirements for travellers on the vtls will result in a higher rate of leakage current border protocols have kept this leakage referring to the number of travellers infected with covid 19 at one infected per thousand travellers he said both experts said that country specific border restrictions merely delay the arrival of the variant into singapore prof hsu said it is highly likely that the omicron variant is already present and circulating in other non african countries that have direct flight connections with africa and singapore he noted that in one case of omicron infection in belgium the patient had neither set foot in south africa nor the other six countries commonly listed in the new travel bans therefore unless the situation changes we are likely to have persons infected by this new variant on our shores within a matter of weeks correction note this story has been updated for accuracy join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

this there would not even be a home for your family and you this school of thought resonates strongly with mr rahul gupta every first sunday of the month the 48 year old leads his wife and 16 year old son as well as fellow neighbours and volunteers on litter picking runs in their estate a resident in the area for 16 years mr gupta is serving his second term as the chairperson of the tanjong rhu neighbourhood committee for safety distancing purposes volunteers are allocated different routes in pairs especially along the tanjong rhu promenade park connector that heads into gardens by the bay this buzzing area has lots of people coming here for picnics and outdoor activities it is great but it also means that a lot of litter is left behind imagine used masks and cigarette butts landing up in the marina reservoir and going into our drinking water says mr gupta every litter picking mission takes about 90 minutes to 120 minutes with each volunteer bagging almost 2kg to 3kg of trash or what amounts to the weight of five basketballs the team usually finds discarded food and drink containers cigarette butts even used socks and once an entire vehicle tyre in addition to these monthly litter picking runs mr gupta's committee also works with nine condominiums at tanjong rhu estate on the walk clean initiative this provides residents with litter picking tools like gloves trash bags and tongs so they can pick up rubbish on their casual walks many people are civic minded and want to help but they do not have the right equipment at the right time on why he is so engaged in keeping his neighbourhood clean the global chief marketing officer at a fintech company says it's all about having a sense of ownership this is my neighbourhood and my country and we all have a bigger role to play we can't leave everything to the authorities or our army of cleaners it's shameful and shows the maturity of our country if we cannot even keep our own country clean i believe in bringing about positive change instead of complaining every small action can contribute to keeping singapore clean we can help to reduce the problem even if we cannot solve it the active community volunteer with the national environment agency nea adds it's important for a small group to lead and show the way you can start small or you won't start at all in his monthly litter picking team the youngest volunteer is 23 while the oldest is 75 proof that age is just a number in keeping singapore clean and green teenager laura lee is an example of how one's age is not an obstacle in being environmentally conscious as a secondary three student at nanyang girls' high school she had already kickstarted zerowastenanyang one of the school's first grounds up environmental movement under this a few initiatives were launched including the strawfreechallenge to eliminate the use of drinking straws in the school canteen she also played a part in implementing the expressqueue to encourage schoolmates to bring their own lunch boxes so that they could cut the lunch queue and pick up their meals quickly outside of school ms lee who admits to loving bubble milk tea like many of her peers brings her own cup and straw rejecting a straw or a cup can go a long way she explains i also believe that incentives can spur good habits instead of the stick we give the carrot in 2018 she started recycling initiative toiletrollsg where students in different schools collected used toilet rolls for every kilogram collected recycling and waste management company veolia gave 5 cents in return toiletrollsg would then donate the sum to support social causes in singapore such as the national kidney foundation to subsidise the dialysis treatments of patients at her own school classes that collected the most toilet rolls one class hauled in 200kg of these won prizes but why toilet rolls they are convenient to collect and also one of the purest forms of waste to recycle because they are made of only one material explains the 18 year old who is studying for her a levels at hwa chong institution initiatives must be economically viable too for example it's more difficult to recycle pens because they are made up of too many different materials like rubber casings metals and plastics which require more resources to separate and it's hard to recycle used straws due to hygiene reasons she hopes that collecting toilet rolls or encouraging the young to cut down on the use of disposables will spur others to start their own initiatives too and create a ripple effect a truly advanced society is about people who are responsible for the future generations some people think that climate change will affect only the future but its impact is present and near case in point the amount of disposed waste in singapore has already gone up seven fold in the last 40 years at this rate semakau landfill which is singapore's only landfill will run out of space by 2035 double whammy there isn't enough land in singapore to build new landfills or incineration plants either not contributing further to e waste is one of the reasons why mr danny lim believes in not buying more than necessary we are consumer driven because replacing something has become easier and cheaper than repairing it the 53 year old and his family invest only in good quality electronics that will last longer or that can be repaired he has a day job as the community innovation lead at sustainable living lab and helps to rescue and repair old electronics under the company's corporate social responsibility initiative repair kopitiam although he did a lot of circuit diagnostic and repair in his previous job and has a background in mechanical engineering mr lim was challenged when he opened up his first item a fan he learnt the ropes along the way and today he can repair air fryers fans toasters and his speciality microwave ovens in fact danny enjoys tinkering so much that he has filled two bedrooms in his home with spare components besides thinking twice before buying he says that another way to cut down on e waste is to maintain and service one's electronics regularly for instance regularly dusting laptops can help facilitate better airflow and prevent it from overheating adopting good everyday habits is something that mr sunnie tan pbm chairman of ayer rajah gek poh constituency community emergency and engagement committee c2e believes in and practises together with his volunteers the 68 year old conducts door to door visits ground engagement and in more recent pandemic times uses chat groups and social media videos to educate residents on the dangers of mosquito breeding and on high rise littering he also works closely with foreign worker ambassadors on communicating these messages to foreign workers living in dormitories in the neighbourhood keeping the mozzies away can be as simple as overturning pails and wiping their rims or changing the water in vases to prevent mosquito breeding with the merchants' association mr tan also educates hawkers market stallholders and shop owners on the risks of mosquito breeding we don't sit around and wait for clusters and cases to happen we want our residents to live in a clean and green environment that is healthy if there are dengue clusters they won't be happy and we want to do our best to give them a happy environment mr rahul gupta ms laura lee mr danny lim and mr sunnie tan are examples of everyday singaporeans who play a role in helping to keep singapore clean and green within their own community and spheres of interest and influence no effort is too small or insignificant when it comes to keeping our home clean and liveable the nea is constantly collaborating with communities individuals and agencies to launch and reinforce initiatives that help build and maintain every singaporean's dream home one of these initiatives is clean and green singapore cgs which aims to inspire singaporeans to care for and protect common spaces create a more gracious society champion a sustainable way of life safeguard green spaces and waterways and develop a zero waste nation and a leading green economy the theme for cgs is caring for our environment together this underscores how singaporeans must collectively take action together and not just take the environment for granted or leave it to others each one can play a part in leading an environmentally friendly lifestyle at home or at work as well as through shared activities with friends and neighbours to find out more about how you can care for the environment either visit www cgs gov sg cgs2021 or participate in cgs experiences an online learning experience which was launched as part of cgs2021 this initiative will offer the public an opportunity to make virtual visits to sites of environmental interest around singapore from the comfort of their homes through virtually touring these sites participants can learn more about the innovative contributions by various organisations towards sustainability and a circular economy the sites chosen are normally not easily accessed by the public cgs experiences will be conducted in the form of webinars with a live host bringing participants through a virtual tour and engaging them with quizzes and q a attractive prizes are up for grabs limited sessions are available for public booking from nov 21 2021 to

        "content": "singapore covid 19 patients who are deaf or hard of hearing can now communicate with the health ministry moh through a short message service sms or e mail the moh calls covid 19 patients over the phone about their recovery plans but the deaf community has given feedback that talking over the phone is not an accessible option for them with the new measures deaf patients can also consult a tele medicine provider through the video or text message function on whatsapp and ask for a sign language interpreter if they need one the moh parliamentary secretary rahayu mahzam gave this update through a facebook post on dec 31 she said covid 19 has been difficult for all of us and i especially empathise with the deaf community who have faced challenges exacerbated by the pandemic i'm grateful to those who have given feedback and insights on specific challenges faced ms rahayu said the moh partnered the ministry of social and family development msf and the singapore association for the deaf sadeaf to enhance the covid 19 management system to make it easier for those who are deaf or hard of hearing to recover at home in her facebook post she said that individuals on the home recovery programme or who are given a health risk warning can now text or e mail the moh to make their communication needs known a case manager will contact them via their preferred mode of communication within 24 hours they are also given the singapore civil defence force emergency contact number by sms if they need emergency assistance covid 19 has been difficult for all of us and i especially empathise with the deaf community who have faced challenges ms rahayu also said that the sadeaf will be sharing more details with members of the deaf community in november last year the straits times reported that former nominated member of parliament anthea ong called for processes to be made more inclusive for covid 19 patients with disabilities she has deaf friends who caught the virus or were close contacts of covid 19 patients and they could not talk to the moh by phone to communicate about their situation or ask for help given their disability at that time like other covid 19 patients they were given a telephone number to call or were asked to visit the government's covid 19 website for more information and assistance she said so they had to depend on their family members or community groups like sg assist for help ms ong and the other disability groups the straits times interviewed such as the sadeaf and the autism resource centre singapore suggested that the authorities set up a text line where deaf people can communicate with moh through text messages sent over the phone the moh told the straits times in november last year that covid 19 patients with disabilities who are eligible to recover at home would be assigned a home recovery care manager who will link them up with various community services and resources among other things and those who do not have an able bodied caregiver at home will be sent to the appropriate care or treatment facility where its staff will attend to their needs sadeaf's executive director judy lim told the straits times it had suggested to the moh and the msf ways to improve the communication processes for deaf covid 19 patients and the sadeaf had offered its services such as in sign language interpretation this has led to a dedicated e mail and sms line for those who are unable or find it hard to receive instructions by phone and provisions for sign language interpretation ms lim said she added sadeaf is heartened by and grateful to the ministries for working on these new and improved measures which will enable and empower deaf and hard of hearing people to understand and manage the processes independently the msf and sg enable an agency that provides services for people with disabilities worked with the moh and the sadeaf to understand the needs of deaf covid 19 patients the msf spokesman said we identified that accessible communication channels are key to enabling deaf covid 19 patients to communicate their healthcare needs and recover safely in their own homes the msf added that people with disabilities who need assistance for covid 19 related matters can approach sg enable for help ms ong is happy to hear that the suggestions have been adopted by the moh but she also pointed out that efforts to include vulnerable groups like people with disabilities must not be left to chance in national emergency preparedness efforts she said our majoritarian thinking is practical and hard to fault in logic and pragmatism but it perpetuates and even widens the divide from a design thinking perspective the problem definition should be 'how can the standard operating procedures

healthcare logistics manufacturing with more industries being added every month snatchjobs rolled out an app in may 2021 to fully integrate the job matching process between its telegram channel and

about roles that required his skills and matched his personal preferences i liked how easy it was to search specifically for the industry i wanted as well as the companies i was interested in that was how i landed my current job says mr poh with many of our everyday transactions now facilitated by apps mr poh appreciates the clear cut interface of the snatchjobs app and the resources offered by the job portal that ensured he was not making any hasty decisions he explains the app allows direct contact with employers or recruiters which is very convenient i was able to get all the information i needed regarding the position and coordinate interview appointments through it snatchjobs co founders terence lai sky fam and william lie started the platform with the aim of offering job seekers access to not just full time positions but pandemic related contract and ad hoc jobs like temperature screeners and safe distancing ambassadors this is relevant especially in the current economic landscape where singaporean companies are pivoting towards hiring contract and freelance staff snatchjobs is responding to that demand while capitalising on the fact that companies are increasingly turning to social media channels to advertise job postings explaining the company's mission mr fam says in everything we do the focus is on the users and how we can make the process as seamless and simple as possible so they can land a job in this challenging economy this is the main purpose behind snatchjobs for instance a job seeker need only to join snatchjobs' network telegram channels to gain instant access to the latest job listings the newly launched app with its user friendly interface has made things even easier for both employers and job seekers to connect with each other directly at the start mr fam says getting companies and recruitment agencies to come on board was challenging the co founders had to literally knock on doors to present their company's mission they resorted to the same to get job seekers and users since then snatchjobs has come a long way plans are underway to introduce multimedia services to the app which will allow candidates to submit video resumes aside from adding more industry sectors to their portfolio of employers snatchjobs hopes to introduce resources such as articles by industry experts tips on resume writing and interview coaching to help job seekers increase their chances of finding employment in addition snatchjobs announced last month that it raised 1 1 million in seed funding led by a private investment firm and

for many who graduated into the workforce during the pandemic the journey has been more turbulent than expected jobs especially good ones are harder to come by should you hold out for your dream job or settle for the first offer should you take up an internship when will the job market return to what it used to be like one recent graduate seeking advice from workforce singapore wsg career coaches asked i am offered a full time position for a job that is not really relevant to what i have studied some sgunited traineeships seem appealing but i am worried the pay would not be enough for me to support myself and my family what should i do another wondered how an sgunited traineeship might set the benchmark for one's career in terms of progression and pay how do i let employers know i deserve a 'normal' pay the graduate asked it is perfectly normal for young job seekers to feel anxious about what seems to be a bleak and uncertain future but the fact is covid 19 is throwing up new opportunities don't let it stop you from getting your career started the key is to be versatile and adaptable wsg career coach sharon wee suggests that fresh graduates develop what they call the triple a mindset adopt adapt and acquire adopt a new mindset by being proactive positive and resilient adapt to the new normal by networking with people outside your immediate circle and keeping abreast of trends and opportunities and acquire new in demand skills while you hunt for jobs do also assess your finances the prevailing market conditions and your existing skills before turning down a job offer that isn't exactly what you had hoped for the reality is not everyone gets to do what they want immediately especially when times are not ideal some people take a longer time to find their dream job but with each career move they make they pick up or hone the skills that eventually help them secure the role they have been wanting to get ms wee advises fresh graduates to stay curious and be open to new opportunities while navigating your preferred interests develop and hone essential soft skills such as interpersonal communications teamwork and analytical skills which will provide you with an edge as you know what it takes to adapt to a workplace environment she adds one good way of demonstrating your adaptability and willingness to learn is through an sgunited traineeships programme the programme features traineeship opportunities of up to six months with a monthly allowance across diverse industries for fresh or soon to be graduates of ite polytechnics and universities as an sgunited trainee you will gain industry relevant skills and build up your professional contacts hence boosting your employability the traineeship may just be your stepping stone to a permanent

last year and set his sights on joining a stable well established company in the logistics and supply chain industry after all he has a polytechnic diploma in international logistics and supply chain management but after sending nearly 20 applications through mycareersfuture mr syakir was going nowhere in his job search finally two months later psa corporation contacted him via the job portal to offer him a trainee role as an assistant cargo solutions executive under the sgunited traineeships programme mr syakir started work in august last year the role required him to liaise daily with customers and partners which improved his teamwork and collaborative skills what he learnt in school also stood him in good stead keeping him on top of day to day freight forwarding operations that required him to prepare documentation keep track of vessel arrivals and shipments status in order to meet customers' service kpis mr syakir's ability to pick up know how and skills was soon rewarded psa offered him a permanent job in january this year ms nur syahidah binte mohamad zaki is another recent graduate who stayed adaptable despite setbacks in her first foray into working life the 21 year old holds nitec certification in opticianry 2017 and a higher nitec certification in chemical technology 2020 but the jobs she was keen on would only accept diploma holders she then turned to the sgunited traineeships programme which she had learnt about at a career fair in the ite ms syahidah had always wondered what went on behind the scenes at pharmacies and was curious about drugs and their application so she kept an eye out for openings in pharmaceutical sciences it took a while but last november ms syahidah was hired as a pharmacy assistant trainee at changi general hospital

        "content": "singapore an additional 800 interim rental housing board flats will be set aside for families waiting for their build to order bto flats to be completed including those facing construction delays but there will be stricter eligibility criteria for those wishing to apply for these units to apply for a unit under the parenthood provisional housing scheme pphs from wednesday aug 4 onwards the household combined monthly income cannot be more than 7 000 said the hdb on tuesday the income reflected at the point of sale application for the bto flat will be the basis for consideration said hdb households whose incomes have fallen to 7 000 and below since their sales application may contact hdb directly the household income ceiling is to ensure that the flats which are highly subsidised are allocated to those who are less able to afford renting a flat on the open market said hdb the pphs provides interim housing to households awaiting the completion of their bto flats with units allocated by ballot rents range from 400 for a two room flat in marsiling 600 for a three roomer in hougang and 1 500 for a four room unit in tiong bahru priority will be given to married couples with children aged 18 and under in the selection of a pphs flat ahead of other eligible applicants this includes expectant parents a one year wait out period will apply to pphs applicants who do not select a flat after being invited twice to do so they will have to wait one year from the date of the second non selection before they can apply for a pphs flat again this also applies to those who did not proceed with payment after selecting a flat the reason is because about half of the applicants who were invited to select a pphs flat eventually did not do so despite a rising number of applications since last year this could be due to a variety of reasons such as locational preferences however this also suggests that not all applicants may be in urgent need of temporary housing and some may be able to continue with their current housing arrangements for some time said hdb the one year wait out period will allow applicants with more urgent housing needs to secure a flat more quickly added hdb pphs exercises will now be held once every two months instead of monthly to consolidate the flats to offer applicants a larger pool of units to choose from this will improve the applicants' chances of securing a flat in each selection exercise and reduce the need for repeated applications said hdb from the next pphs exercise in october applicants will have 14 days to submit their application on tuesday hdb said that about 200 of the additional 800 pphs units will be ready this year and progressively released for application from the fourth quarter these additional flats include vacated flats at sites currently undergoing the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme sers flats which are unsold and possibly vacant staff apartments at various polytechnics that are available temporarily there are around 840 existing units under the scheme demand for the interim flats also doubled last year as more families were affected by construction delays to bto units due to the covid 19 pandemic the hdb had received 2 350 applications under the pphs compared with 1 370 in 2019 the scheme has supported more than 3 000 families since it began in 2013 the stricter eligibility conditions and allocation process come as hdb said the supply of pphs flats remains limited even as hdb increases its stock of such units on tuesday national development minister desmond lee said in a facebook post that demand for pphs flats has doubled since the start of the pandemic because of bto construction delays he noted that more people are looking for their own space as they work from home and that competition for open market rental has increased due to the covid 19 pandemic at the same time the supply of pphs flats has become even tighter said mr lee while pphs tenants usually stay in their rental flat for about two years or more the delays in bto completion mean that these tenants now stay longer in their pphs flats thus slowing down the return of the flats to hdb for subsequent tenants said mr lee the shortage of construction workers has also led to delays in sprucing up the flats after they are returned to hdb and this has increased the time taken for the vacated flats to be rented out to new tenants he added households waiting for their bto flats are encouraged by hdb to continue living with their families or consider renting from the open market potential home buyers should also take into account the waiting time of bto flats before making a purchase and plan ahead for interim housing options hdb added an accountant who wanted to be known as ms low 27 said she was disappointed to hear of the income cap as her combined household income was slightly above 7 000 when she and her husband applied for a toa payoh bto flat last february the couple have a 10 month old baby they were hoping to get a pphs unit as their bto flat will be ready only in 2026 ms low is living with her in laws but cites space constraints as the main reason for wanting to move out six adults and one baby are now living in a five room hdb flat with a current combined household income of around 10 000 she said it is possible to rent on the open market but was concerned it would take up a substantial chunk of their take home pay it's not like i'm being greedy and want to live off subsidised housing when i can afford renting on the open market but raising a kid doesn't come cheap and paying rental outside makes it difficult to save for rainy days and future bto renovation she said join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered

        "content": "singapore as property seekers continue to home in on flats in mature estates the housing board hdb has rolled out more build to order bto projects in these prime locations it said on sunday july 25 that 13 such projects were offered last year compared with nine in 2017 an almost 50 per cent rise projects in mature estates formed 44 per cent of the overall bto launches in 2017 but the proportion climbed to 55 per cent last year said hdb still it was not easy to bag a unit in a choice area like bishan toa payoh or kallang whampoa the average application rate for a bto flat in mature estates rose from 2 8 times in 2017 to 6 7 times last year the average rates in non mature estates which include bukit batok and tengah were 2 1 times in 2017 and 4 8 times last year overall there has been buoyant demand for new flats in the past four years with the number of applicants vying for each bto unit increasing from 2 3 in 2017 to 5 8 in 2020 some projects in particular have drawn sky high interest in the may launch telok blangah beacon in bukit merah attracted almost 50 applicants for each of its 70 four room flats despite a waiting time of more than five years for the project to be completed and a starting price of 602 000 national development minister desmond lee said in a facebook post on sunday that almost 25 600 new flats have been launched in mature estates in the last four years mr lee said that he had received messages from young couples asking for assistance to apply for bto flats in mature estates they wish to start their own families in a new home but yet live close enough to their parents who are already living in these mature estates for mutual care and support he said at the same launch a four room unit in the non mature estate of woodlands started from 275 000 the longer waiting time is caused by covid 19 construction delays previously buyers of a standard bto flat waited about three to four years to get their keys flats in mature estates were equally hotly contested in recent sale of balance flats sbf exercises which typically happen twice a year they offer units not taken up or returned by buyers after selection from previous bto exercises in which the projects are completed or in various stages of construction the average sbf application rate in mature estates is 5 4 times compared with 4 8 in non mature areas some mature towns with fewer bto projects proved to be more popular with home seekers such as clementi with an application rate of 8 3 times and queenstown with 6 4 times on sunday hdb said the overall strong demand for public housing can be attributed to marriage and family formation as well as changing lifestyles and social aspirations data from the latest census showed that the number of married couples rose from 880 800 in 2010 to 977 300 last year with more marriages registered in the second half of the decade compared with the first in the near term higher demand can be expected from the larger cohorts of people born in the late 1980s to 1990s as they reach marriageable age said hdb it noted that more young couples singles and their parents prefer to live on their own instead of with extended families as average household sizes fell from 3 5 persons in 2010 to 3 2 last year there is also an increasing preference to live close to family members findings from the hdb sample household survey which is conducted once every five years showed that married couples aged 54 and below who chose to live near their parents grew from 21 per cent in 2013 to 24 3 per cent in 2018 the same trend was linked to older residents aged 55 and above with the proportion of those living near their married children increasing from 21 4 per cent in 2013 to 22 9 per cent in 2018 more have also taken up the hdb's proximity housing grant phg which gives buyers up to 30 000 to buy a resale flat within 4km of their parents' or child's hdb flat or private property from 2017 to last year resale transactions that tapped the phg expanded by about 21 per cent across both mature and non mature estates still there are many who prefer bto homes in established locations a fact acknowledged by hdb while the majority of past bto supply has traditionally come from the non mature estates there is a continued need to provide for more new flats in mature estates as well so that the children of hdb residents living in mature estates can also have the opportunity to live close to their parents and parents in law for better family support it said mr lee has said that hdb plans to build bto flats in prime areas and a new housing model will be introduced to keep these flats affordable and inclusive while the locations of prime areas have yet to be defined it is understood that these will be what hdb typically considers as mature estates they will include the future greater southern waterfront and city centre hdb said it will continue to maintain a steady supply of bto flats and is on track to launch about 17 000 units this year as planned this will be supplemented by flats offered through sbf exercises and open bookings this year's supply is higher than the 14 600 flats launched in 2019 and 16 800 last year next month hdb will offer about 4 900 bto flats in hougang jurong east kallang whampoa queenstown and tampines about 3 100 to 3 600 bto flats will be offered in choa chu

        "content": "singapore resale prices for housing board flats climbed for the fifth consecutive quarter though the volume of transactions was hit by tightened covid 19 measures property analysts expect that prices are likely to rise further with demand outstripping supply in part due to delays in completion of new hdb flats in the second quarter of this year resale prices rose 3 per cent over the previous three months matching the increase seen in the first quarter according to data released by the hdb on friday july 23 the figure is higher than hdb's initial estimate of a 2 8 per cent rise made three weeks ago hdb resale volume shrank 6 8 per cent over the previous quarter amid phase two heightened alert measures when households were allowed to receive only two unique visitors each day the number of transactions fell to 7 063 down from 7 581 in the first quarter year on year however resale transactions were 106 2 per cent higher due to circuit breaker measures in 2020 aside from limited viewings during the heightened alert phase in may to june some sellers' refusal to budge on asking prices also slowed transactions said huttons group chief executive mark yip ms christine sun orangetee tie senior vice president of research and analytics noted that current resale prices are just 2 per cent below their peak in the second quarter of 2013 and that prices are likely to reach a new high by the second half of 2021 resale prices have also risen 6 per cent in the first six months of this year and 11 per cent since the circuit breaker period in the second quarter of 2020 while there was a slight pullback in sales volume in the second quarter buyer demand remains strong and transactions were still higher than pre pandemic levels ms sun said the strong demand and home supply shortage may keep resale prices elevated in the coming months she added construction delays are expected for many build to order bto projects and many young couples with urgent housing needs may continue to turn to the resale market although the supply lag may begin to ease next year when construction activities continue to pick up mr yip shared these sentiments noting that the strong price gains reflect the shifting focus from new flats to resale units due to delays in construction completion it may also indicate that more buyers are asking for higher prices which may result in more instances of cash over valuation he said more than 14 000 resale flats were transacted in the first half of the year which makes it the highest first half year sales since 2010 when 17 598 units were sold mr yip said that the resale market could see sales volume of between 27 000 and 29 000 units this year and this would be the highest since 2010 the number of approved applications to rent out hdb flats rose 2 8 per cent to 10 979 cases in the second quarter compared with the previous three month period approved rental applications were also 4 2 per cent higher compared with the same period last year as at the end of june there were 57 755 hdb flats rented out 0 7 per cent lower than the previous quarter hdb will launch about 4 900 bto flats in queenstown kallang whampoa tampines jurong east and hougang next month another 3 100 to 3 600 bto flats will be offered in choa chu kang hougang jurong west kallang whampoa and tengah in november join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "singapore the parliamentary committee looking into the conduct of former workers' party wp mp raeesah khan will meet again on monday dec 20 the deadline for three wp leaders to respond to a summons to provide documents hearings held by the committee of privileges have revealed that after ms khan lied in parliament on aug 3 she confessed to wp chief pritam singh party chairman sylvia lim and vice chairman faisal manap at a meeting on aug 8 they reached an explicit collective decision for her to come clean only on oct 12 on nov 1 in parliament ms khan admitted in a statement that she had lied about accompanying a sexual assault victim to the police station and revealed her own sexual assault 10 years ago as a student these are the facts agreed by ms khan as well as mr singh ms lim and mr faisal in their testimonies but where they differ is the explanation on why it had taken almost three months for ms khan to come clean here are the key areas where their accounts differ ms khan said mr singh had called a meeting with her ms lim and mr manap on aug 8 the day after she confessed to him about her lie the meeting was held in mr singh's home coming clean at the meeting ms khan told them she had heard the anecdote at a support group which she attended as a victim revealing that she had experienced a serious sexual assault when she was 18 years old and studying in australia asked how the leaders reacted ms khan said there was incredible disappointment she added during her testimony on dec 2 there was a lot of anger but i think there was some compassion there as well as to what the leaders told her to do about the lie she said the reaction was that if i were not to be pressed then the best thing to do would be to retain the narrative that i began in august shortly after the meeting ended ms khan sent a whatsapp message to wp cadres loh pei ying and yudhishthra nathan to update them she told them that the three senior wp leaders had asked her to take the information to the grave the leader of the opposition said he first heard about the lie on aug 7 when ms khan called him he had asked if the anecdote she related was true and she said no it made him so incensed that he hung up on her i was really angry i cut the call he told the committee it was after this phone call that he arranged for the aug 8 meeting mr singh has categorically denied any instruction for ms khan to continue with her lie and said at a hearing on dec 10 this rendition of what has happened is a complete utter fabrication it's a lie it's a bare lie he told the committee there was no discussion with ms khan about the lie at all at this meeting because the party leaders were more focused on her well being given the state that she was in instead after ms khan's confession they moved on to talk about female genital cutting and polygamy which ms khan had also covered in her aug 3 speech as far as ms khan's confession was concerned all mr singh said to her was that they would have to deal with the issue and she would have to speak to her parents he told the committee i don't think it went beyond that he said he also said that due to the trauma ms khan had suffered he decided to give ms khan time and did not discuss with her how to make a correction about the lie in addition he also did not discuss the matter with ms lim mr faisal or reveal anything to other party leaders ms lim too said nothing was asked of ms khan about her lie her main takeaway from that meeting was that ms khan had to speak to her parents before anything else could be done she added she said the leaders had asked ms khan to get therapy to stabilise herself after ms khan left ms lim said she did not discuss the matter further with mr singh and mr faisal she added i knew in my mind that the next steps will have to come but at that point in time we didn't talk about the next steps ms lim said she subsequently left it to mr singh to follow up with ms khan as he knew her best and was the one guiding her during her parliamentary stint ms khan had helped out in mr singh's eunos ward before being fielded as a candidate in the 2020 general election and he had also been communicating on and off with ms khan's family mr faisal too had told the committee that he had not done anything about the lie since he fully trusted that mr singh would handle the matter it was only on oct 3 that ms khan would speak again with any party leaders about her lie she met mr singh in her home that day to discuss the matter she told the committee that no one else was around and that he had told her he had an inkling she might be pressed about her untrue anecdote during the parliament sitting on oct 4 in her view mr singh had left it up to her to handle the matter as she deemed fit including if she chose to continue lying the conversation was that if i were to retain the narrative or if i were to continue the narrative there will be no judgment she told the committee my interpretation was that there'll be no consequences for me to continue the narrative that i had begun in august on oct 4 ms khan repeated the lie in parliament when asked for more details about her anecdote by home affairs and law minister k shanmugam while mr shanmugam was speaking about the matter ms khan had sent mr singh a text message asking what should i do pritam asked by the committee if mr singh had asked her why she did not tell the truth that day she said no but she added i think regardless of the discussion that i had i agree that it was my responsibility to come forth with the truth and i take full responsibility for that i think despite advice i should have taken the step to rectify my mistake then mr singh recalled he had gone to ms khan's house at around 6pm on oct 3 and that her whole family was at home contrary to her account he described how he had a short conversation with ms khan's father and mother on that day and also said hello to her husband and saw her son mr singh said he had told ms khan it was possible she might be asked about her untruthful anecdote in parliament and it was important that she take responsibility and take ownership of the issue he told the committee that at no point did ms khan ask him for help guidance or advice about what to do and then i told her 'i will not judge you' and 'i will not judge you' meant 'i will not judge you if you take responsibility and ownership' that was the gist of the conversation mr singh said he had no doubt in his mind that on oct 4 ms khan knew she should have told the truth if questioned because i had told her to take ownership and responsibility so in my mind it would have been clear what the right thing to do was explaining why he did nothing even though he knew she was lying again mr singh said that as at oct 4 he did not know if ms khan had spoken to her parents about the matter and so could not possibly have corrected ms khan on the spot he also told the committee that every wp mp is a leader in his own right and is expected to take responsibility so it was ms khan's prerogative to set the record right i believe the leader of the opposition a party leader doesn't take an oath on behalf of all his mps each mp takes an oath on their own standing on their own merit he said every workers' party mp is a leader they have to take responsibility after lying again on oct 4 a distraught ms khan met mr singh in his office in parliament house together with ms lim there she told mr singh and ms lim that perhaps there was another path of truth and honesty mr singh told the committee ms lim told the committee nothing else was ironed out at the late night meeting on oct 4 which ended with mr singh saying they would discuss the matter further ms lim said neither she nor mr singh had indicated when ms khan should make a statement in parliament though this was what she had in mind the wp chairman also said she was very frustrated when ms khan stuck to her untrue anecdote that day because it didn't appear that there had been any progress made on moving towards correcting the record and in fact there was doubling down on the untruth she added that when she met ms khan separately before the meeting with mr singh she had told ms khan that an issue brought up in parliament should be dealt with by parliament since things said in the house are protected by privilege implicit in this was the expectation that ms khan would have to own up ms lim said though she never explicitly told ms khan to tell the truth at this meeting the party leaders also did not ask ms khan if she had already told her parents about her past sexual assault the collective decision to come clean was reached only on oct 12 during a meeting with mr singh and ms lim ms khan said she said mr singh had called a meeting with her and ms lim in the morning and that after a discussion all three of them decided together that she would have to tell the truth in parliament on her own reasons she said for me personally the consideration was that this was something that would weigh on me for the rest of my life and because of that it was something that i needed to clarify i don't think i could have lived with myself the other concern was like i mentioned as well my mental health because i think it was obvious that this was really affecting me and that i needed to clarify it for my own conscience asked why her party leaders wanted her to tell the truth ms khan said i think their consideration was that the matter will not be dropped after the meeting she spoke to ms loh and mr nathan the wp cadres separately and told them about having to make a statement in parliament to set the record straight mr singh told the committee that ms khan had been unwilling to come clean even at this stage contrary to her testimony and had to be compelled to do so by the wp leaders she didn't want to tell the truth sylvia gets angry i know because i remember quite clearly he said recounting their oct 12 discussion he added that he told ms khan that she had no choice but to confess as the matter was not going to go away don't even think that this is going to be just left alone they also discussed the statement she would make he said and ms khan was told to write her own statement and show it to party leaders before she read it out in parliament at the next sitting the reason why i felt it was important to look at what she was saying was i'm not sure what she's going to say in a personal explanation on nov 1 he said so you better show me what you're going to say don't come up with some cockamamie lie again at this point the party's central executive committee cec the top decision making body was still not aware of the matter mr singh said the party leaders did not reveal the lie to the cec until oct 29 the cec also did not know that mr singh ms lim and mr faisal had known about the matter since early august when they subsequently deliberated an internal disciplinary panel's recommendations on ms khan the panel had comprised solely of the three top wp leaders ms lim said mr singh started off the meeting by asking ms khan if she had decided what she was going to do about her lie to this ms khan had replied i still don't think i want to tell the truth at that point i got angry and i think pritam was also angry and we told her that this correction has to be made ms lim told the committee we tried to persuade her by saying that if you do not make the correction this is going to weigh on you for the rest of your life and it's too much of a burden for anyone to bear you need to correct this so that everyone is clear and we can move on from there eventually ms khan agreed to make a statement in parliament though it became clear she had not told her parents yet of her sexual assault as at oct 12 ms lim said ms loh and mr nathan initiated a meeting with mr singh on the night of oct 12 after ms khan told them she would have to make a statement in parliament mr nathan said they were concerned about how the statement would be worded and how it would impact ms khan's mental health they also wanted to know what would happen next since they usually assisted ms khan with her speeches and social media accounts in the course of party work during that meeting at mr singh's home they learnt that mr singh had met ms khan on oct 3 and that he had told ms khan he had a feeling the issue might come up the next day they said ms loh told the committee i don't know the full details of what he said to her but he shared with me that he said 'i will not judge you' to ms raeesah khan mr nathan said mr singh had expressed to us that regardless of whether she had maintained the line of argument of maintaining the survivor's or the victim's confidentiality or whether she decided to tell the truth that he would not judge her mr singh acknowledged that he had a conversation with them about what he told ms khan on oct 3 he said while he did not narrate the entire episode about his conversation with ms khan on oct 3 he did tell the two party members that he expected ms khan to take ownership and responsibility for the matter it was in this context that he told them about telling ms khan i will not judge you mr singh explained to the committee that what he meant was ms khan was a leader in her own right and had a choice in the matter to me that was my way of communicating to them that raeesah would have been quite clear in her mind that she had to tell the truth he said mr singh also speculated that ms loh and mr nathan may have had a skewed impression of their conversation with him because they were very protective of ms khan join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you

as at thursday singapore had confirmed 24 cases with one more announced as preliminarily positive the government has warned that it is a matter of a time before there is a surge of omicron infections in the community one potentially larger than delta's observers say singapore is well poised to handle the new strain with the experience gleaned from various outbreaks and road bumps over the past two years the result is an omicron strategy reflecting an abundance of caution in walking a line between restrictions and keeping the economy open while fine tuning the balance along the way it is an approach also consistent with the measured shift to living with covid 19 experts say singapore is most certainly on track to covid 19 resilience says dr woo jun jie a senior research fellow at the institute of policy studies think tank adding that the path will require a calibrated and sometimes start stop approach that builds up covid 19 immunity in a safe and controlled manner the omicron variant first detected in botswana on nov 11 and south africa on nov 14 has been reported by nearly 80 countries and counting the world health organisation who has warned against dismissing it as a mild disease noting that a sheer number of cases could still overwhelm unprepared healthcare systems singapore on tuesday announced a slew of measures to avoid such a scenario with a strong focus on vaccination as a key plank among other moves it is considering tweaking the definition of fully vaccinated from two jabs to include a third booster shot and will extend vaccination differentiated measures to more places and events from february hospital and testing capacities are also being boosted including by increasing the number of intensive care unit beds from 280 to 500 earlier border and testing protocols were tightened for countries affected by omicron and travellers arriving by quarantine free vaccinated travel lanes vtls together these measures aim to slow the entry of omicron to singapore delay its eventual community circulation increase the ability to detect its presence as well as protect people while ensuring capacity to care for those who are infected says professor teo yik ying dean of the saw swee hock school of public health at national university of singapore nus and all in advance of omicron establishing a permanent foothold in singapore he notes this to me is a comprehensive response meanwhile singapore's reopening plans are continuing in tandem it now has 24 vtls and an arrangement with malaysia will be expanded from monday to allow vaccinated singaporeans and malaysians to cross the causeway come jan 1 up to 50 per cent of workers who are currently able to work from home will also be allowed to return to the office the viability of our economy as well as citizen employment are just as important in safeguarding lives and livelihoods says dr woo early in the pandemic singapore kept cases in the community to a handful with the help of a two month circuit breaker although nearly half of about 320 000 migrant workers contracted the virus while sequestered in cramped dormitories for most of last year this year the delta variant was the main menace sparking several clusters of infections including at tan tock seng hospital bukit merah food centre changi airport ktv outlets and jurong fishery port from april to august in september a protocol switch to mostly home based isolation led to frustration and confusion over logistical issues and rapid covid 19 spread in the community this change was not handled well says associate professor alex cook vice dean of research at the saw swee hock school of public health now that our protocols are more commensurate with what is a mostly mild illness in vaccinated people we shouldn't experience the same systemic problems as daily cases climbed into the thousands from late september and the number of deaths hit a record 18 in a single day in october public dissatisfaction mounted over a perception of stop start measures and mixed messaging over the government's intentions to actually live with the coronavirus on nov 20 nearly two months of strict curbs came to an end with infection numbers and the hospital situation largely stabilised throughout the pandemic singapore has been a lot more cautious and also agile in our responses particularly in implementing and lifting any public health measures this has led to the regrettable impression that there are sometimes policy flip flops says prof teo of nus he points out that the alternative would have been a blunt sledgehammer approach of imposing a widespread lockdown as many other cities have done though the total count now stands at nearly 275 000 cases most were asymptomatic or mild and out of more than 800 deaths most were elderly people with underlying medical conditions of which a large proportion were also unvaccinated running in parallel to the delta wave was a vaccination effort that took singapore's total population from being 8 per cent fully inoculated in april to 87 per cent today about 30 per cent have also received booster shots a figure projected to rise to 54 per cent by the end of january singapore's continued focus on vaccination is clear since dec 8 the government has also stopped paying covid 19 medical bills for those unvaccinated by choice observers see the high level of vaccination accelerated roll out of boosters increased vigilance in the healthcare sector and at ports and borders as well as the lack of significant clusters in recent weeks as indications of singapore having learnt its lessons of the past 24 months this has helped inform the city state's approach to dealing with omicron and put it in a good position to do so says prof cook almost all adults are vaccinated a third of us are boosted and some of us perhaps 10 per cent to 15 per cent have been infected already so the level of protection in the population is quite high he notes if booster uptake is high enough then we might not need to tighten measures during a tuesday press conference on preparations for omicron health minister ong ye kung said going back to stricter restrictions must be a last resort the economist intelligence unit's country analyst for asia yu liuqing says that unless evidence emerges of omicron being more lethal and able to escape immunity mechanisms a tightening in social restrictions would go against singapore's endemic goal adjunct professor lutfey siddiqi of nus' risk management institute describes the shift from pandemic to endemic as such a transition and evolution of habits expectations and behaviours even as a race between the build up of healthcare capacity and mutations of the virus plays out in the background mr ong this week also said that living with covid 19 as an endemic disease means that with each wave singapore should find itself growing more resilient this vision of a coronavirus resilient singapore first raised in the middle of this year has undergirded the nation's fight against the virus according to prof siddiqi covid 19 resilience is exemplified by not only high levels of vaccination and healthcare capacity but equally importantly the state of mind of the people countries with a policy of clear consistent and repeated communication about the direction of travel and drivers of decision making have built social resilience he explains as to whether singapore ticks this box the jury is still out with the government having to deal with its share of public communication stumbles over the past two years the result today is a tension between two distinct public schools of thought on its covid 19 strategy says associate professor walter theseira from the singapore university of social sciences one is that singapore should have pursued zero covid 19 and that reopening has not been worth the trade off in infections and deaths the other is that singapore has been too cagey in embracing living with covid 19 with the lessened public health impact not worth the trade off in economic damage many people of course take positions somewhere in the middle says prof theseira i think

        "content": "singapore the multi ministry task force tackling the covid 19 pandemic has warned that an omicron wave is imminent and that singapore needs to be prepared meanwhile the daily number of new covid 19 cases globally topped 1 6 million for the first time on dec 29 and numbers have remained above a million a day since then they crossed the two million mark on wednesday and hit 2 5 million on thursday jan 5 and 6 even though omicron is believed to cause a much milder illness than delta some places seeing a surge in cases are finding their healthcare systems stretched to breaking point so where does singapore stand today and what can we expect in the coming months health minister ong ye kung said omicron now accounts for almost 20 per cent of all new community cases here so it is likely to become the dominant strain in circulation fairly soon covid 19 cases have been rising here with more infections in the last three months of the year than the total number of people infected in the previous 20 months there were close to 100 000 infections here between the first case in january 2020 till the end of september 2021 with more than half the cases coming from the foreign worker dormitory outbreak that started in april 2020 but by year end the number of people infected with covid 19 had jumped to just under 280 000 cases almost tripling in just three months this was before the advent of omicron and this number does not include people who are asymptomatic or are mildly ill but tested positive through self administered antigen rapid tests the experts all agree that the year end surge is the result of singapore relaxing measures and opening up associate professor alex cook vice dean of research at the national university of singapore's nus saw swee hock school of public health said the upswing followed the relaxation of social measures after national day which led to enough socialisation to push the r reproduction value above 1and spark the beginning of the wave then when measures were tightened again the epidemic continued to grow because of the switch to home based isolation and quarantine which is inherently more 'leaky' than institutional isolation measures added prof cook professor leo yee sin executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases ncid said the surge in the last quarter was largely contributed by the delta variant which arrived in singapore in april 2021 this variant spreads far more easily than previous variants she said adding there is also a longer duration of viral shedding among the unvaccinated prof leo said that at the height of the spread the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 1 4 which means one infected person would spread the disease to 1 4 other people infections started to fall last month as community immunity went up through a combination of high vaccine coverage and infection as well as some tightening of safe measurement measures however just as singapore was getting a handle on delta infections omicron is now in the community and experts foresee a tsunami of infections the infection rate is again above 1 this week indicating a growth in numbers said associate professor hsu li yang an infectious diseases expert at the nus' saw swee hock school of public health i believe there will be an omicron wave we have started to see the beginnings of this here and nearly every country so far has had a similar experience once omicron started spreading in the community prof leo added many affected regions have reported a sharp increase in cases higher risk of reinfection and vaccine breakthrough despite high local vaccine coverage we anticipate likewise that we will experience a sharp rise of cases this is because the omicron variant is even more transmissible than the delta variant has a shorter incubation period and quicker doubling time of around two to three days she explained said prof cook probably once omicron is really established we'll see another wave as other countries are experiencing however because most of our immune systems have been primed by vaccination or even infection this might not lead to a similarly large wave of severe cases prof hsu agrees that while there might be a surge in cases it will be different from the delta wave without hospitalisations and deaths surging in tandem associate professor david allen an infectious diseases expert at nus also says that an omicron wave is likely to result in fewer cases of serious illness and if it has less impact on the healthcare system singapore will likely see further relaxation of measures he added if and when there are spikes in cases requiring hospitalisations the population will alter their behaviour to decrease risk and the government will slow the step wise relaxation or consider a brief period of a moderate increase of measures both of which independently will lead to a drop in cases according to international data the omicron variant does not appear to infiltrate and do damage to the lungs unlike earlier variants where many seriously ill patients required oxygen supplementation said prof leo so while we brace ourselves for a sharp and ferocious omicron wave we hope that it will cause less lung damage where many may require mechanical oxygen support in intensive care minister ong said at the press conference on jan 5 that singapore has seen a total of 2 252 cases of which three required oxygen supplementation all have been taken off oxygen within three days so all three are now recovering none has required icu intensive care unit care as yet so if these same 2 252 infections had been caused by delta based on our experience we would expect about 30 individuals to require oxygen supplementation icu or die but the vast majority of these omicron cases are vaccinated travellers who tend to be younger and healthier than the local cohort hospitalised with the delta variant prof leo is concerned about omicron's effect on older people and those with underlying medical conditions especially if they are unvaccinated since the majority of cases reported so far are in younger people those who have been vaccinated or have had prior infections while more data is urgently needed she said early observations suggest that although vaccines appear less effective at preventing infection the effectiveness against severe illness appears relatively less affected but there are still 38 000 seniors in singapore who remain unvaccinated another possible piece of good news is that reinfection appears to be a one way road with people previously infected remaining at risk of getting omicron but those infected with omicron appear relatively immune to earlier variants said prof leo some early data suggested that omicron cases have neutralisation ability against delta and that will likely prevent infection in the reverse direction it is too early to determine whether omicron would be a milestone towards virus attenuation and broaden neutralising ability so what does the rest of the year hold in store there will be no changes before chinese new year next month but beyond that things might start looking up prof cook said obviously we can't foretell the emergence of new variants especially curveballs like omicron and whether they will set us back further on the return to normalcy singapore's high vaccination rates and growing booster rates position us well for the omicron wave and we ought not to be overly cautious about reopening prof allen expects that travel restrictions will gradually decrease in the coming months and the size of gatherings will increase step wise though masks will still be routinely worn prof hsu also expects to see more people travelling he said there may be more new variants of covid 19 but probably no new variants of concern as alarming as the delta variant as the economy opens and normal travel resumes prof leo urged everyone to continue taking personal responsibility because the steps taken to prevent covid 19 have helped reduce respiratory illnesses as a whole good habits borne out of covid 19 are to be kept and

        "content": "singapore about 38 000 seniors remain unvaccinated at this point down from 200 000 a few months ago said health minister ong ye kung on wednesday jan 5 he had previously said in july last year that 200 000 seniors had yet to take the jab speaking at a virtual press conference by the multi ministry task force tackling covid 19 which he co chairs mr ong acknowledged on wednesday that international data has shown the initial doses of vaccines provide weaker protection against the omicron variant as compared with the delta variant protection against the omicron variant provided by the initial doses also wanes typically after five to six months but he added however boosters will restore the vaccine protection against infection and severe illnesses from omicron vaccination and boosters therefore continue to be our primary response and despite the weaker protection vaccines and boosters still help provide substantial protection against severe disease and hospitalisation for cases infected with the omicron variant said mr ong for instance he said britain has estimated that being fully vaccinated is 72 per cent effective in preventing hospitalisation for such cases while having a booster shot is 88 per cent effective in doing so singapore's director of medical services kenneth mak who was also at the press conference added the overseas data shows that vaccination does make a difference in protecting individuals against infection hospitalisation severe infection and death and this benefit is even stronger for those who have been fully vaccinated and who have received their booster dose around the same time as the press conference the expert committee on covid 19 vaccination issued a statement saying that those who had taken two or more doses of sinovac's or sinopharm's vaccines which are non mrna vaccines as part of a three dose vaccination series are strongly recommended to get one dose of an mrna vaccine as a booster those who took two doses of sinovac's or sinopharm's vaccines and then got an mrna vaccine as their third dose should get an mrna booster about five months after their last dose while those who took sinovac's or sinopharm's vaccines as their third dose should get the mrna booster within three months this is because of lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose said the expert committee meanwhile sinovac's vaccine should be considered as a booster only for those who are medically ineligible to receive mrna vaccines all other persons should be boosted with the mrna vaccines said the committee during the press conference the task force was asked whether the novavax vaccine which is expected to be available around the time those who took non mrna vaccines are due for their booster shots will be accepted as a booster shot the novavax vaccine is not an mrna vaccine in response associate professor mak said the health sciences authority is currently completing its evaluation of the vaccine and a statement will be issued soon he added that he anticipates the novavax vaccine will be accepted as a booster shot the evidence to date shows a better vaccine effectiveness against delta and omicron compared to some other non mrna vaccines that we have available in singapore so there is a very high likelihood that we will make further recommendations concerning the use of novavax as a booster vaccine as part of the national vaccination programme he said adding that the expert committee will first need to make its recommendations on the vaccine mr ong giving an update on singapore's vaccination programme said that currently about 50 000 jabs are being delivered every day these include booster shots prof mak added that as at monday about 89 per cent of the population have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 87 per cent of the population have been fully vaccinated nearly 95 per cent of those aged 70 and up have completed their vaccination regime and more than 96 per cent of those aged between 60 and 69 have done so forty two per cent of the entire population have also received their booster shots prof mak said we urge as many people as possible who are eligible to come forward and receive their booster vaccinations as soon as possible we are still seeing delta infections not just omicron infections and getting vaccinated and boosted protects you against both variants there is no good reason to think that you may skip the booster vaccination simply because you think that omicron infections are potentially less serious join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

infections brought about by the new omicron variant said finance minister lawrence wong on wednesday jan 5 group sizes for gathering and dining at restaurants have been capped at five since november when singapore emerged from an outbreak caused by the earlier delta variant mr wong who is a co chair of the multi ministry task force handling covid 19 said during a press conference that the present posture would be maintained as he could not imagine the omicron wave passing before chinese new year chinese new year may be a time when omicron cases are rising he said so we cannot afford to have more superspreader events taking place during that time and therefore we would like to encourage and urge everyone to continue exercising personal and social responsibility and to comply and cooperate with all the safe management measures let's all do our part to keep our family members our friends and our loved ones safe even as we usher in the new year mr wong pointed to the new year s eve celebration at clarke quay which enforcement agencies are investigating as an example of a potential superspreading event with blatant unacceptable breaches of safe management measures smms the gathering was caught on video and is believed to have involved hundreds in a spontaneous countdown party our investigations showed that this was not an organised event said mr wong what happened was that people started gathering together they got caught up in the moment and soon we had a crowd of more than 100 people at that location with many flouting the rules no smms no safe distancing and clearly it was a potential superspreader event he added such actions are not acceptable especially when we are still in the midst of a pandemic we are reviewing cctv footage to identify the culprits these people will be called in for interviews and enforcement action will be taken against those who have breached the rules mr wong stressed that the intention was to stick as far as possible with the current set of smms to ride through the coming wave of omicron infections we don t intend to relax further at this time and we will try not to have to tighten he said but he added in the event that the healthcare system comes under tremendous pressure then as a last resort we may have no choice but to tighten some of our measures there were 842 new covid 19 cases in singapore as at tuesday with the weekly infection growth rate the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before exceeding one for the first time since nov 12 this indicates that the number of new weekly covid 19 cases is increasing omicron infections now make up close to 20 per cent of cases in singapore and officials have warned of an imminent wave that the country must be prepared for on wednesday mr wong added the indicators now suggest that this surge of omicron infections in the community will be happening soon he said singapore has done everything it can to brace for this such as by using the relative period of calm in december to strengthen its healthcare system and to review and update healthcare protocols our situation in singapore is different from that in america and many european countries there they had moved to liberalise open up remove many if not all of their restrictions then when the omicron surge happened in these countries many of them reinstated restrictions as you can see over the recent period mr wong said in singapore we have maintained the whole series of basic and sensible safe management measures be it wearing of masks keeping a safe distance from one another or having group sizes maintained at a certain level we believe these safe management measures are important and appropriate singapore s key priority is to protect its healthcare system he added he said so if our hospital beds and our icus intensive care units are not overwhelmed then indeed we will be able to ride through this upcoming wave based on our current smm settings and we are hopeful that this will indeed be the case especially given the indications that omicron cases are not as severe but we also must be prepared for all contingencies mr wong acknowledged that there was considerable fatigue and frustration in keeping up with the rules over the past two year battle against covid 19 but he urged people to continue to stay disciplined and to comply with smms then we have a much higher chance of getting through this upcoming wave without having to tighten further he said but if we were to let our guard down and take unnecessary risks then transmission will be amplified the infection wave will be much larger we will end up with greater pressure on our healthcare system and we may have no choice but to tighten join st's telegram channel here and get the

quarantine exemptions for fully vaccinated inbound travellers it announced plans to impose a 10 day quarantine on all inbound travellers from friday the measure came after south korea confirmed its first five cases of the omicron variant late on wednesday including a fully vaccinated couple who arrived last week from nigeria followed by two of their family members and a friend south korea is among countries that have reintroduced quarantine requirements for travellers in response to omicron many countries including singapore have tightened covid 19 requirements for travellers as well the

        "content": "singapore the expanded vaccinated travel lane vtl scheme here has given the meetings incentives conventions and exhibitions mice sector a boost with industry players noting growing interest among their clients mr mathias posch president of international conference services told the straits times that several large scale conferences are now considering singapore as a destination including discussions about relocating conferences from other asian destinations to the republic he said the vtls are an important signal to our industry that singapore is opening up to international travel and that helps with booking hesitancy that we have experienced in recent months it is a good start and shows the commitment of the government to having international travel resume asia pacific managing director for bcd meetings and events mr sanjay seth said its singapore office alone has received a dozen new inquiries since oct 9 when the first major expansion of the vtl scheme was announced the scheme which allows quarantine free travel between singapore and several countries is a significant step for the industry here which relies heavily on foreign attendees and in person networking the countries include the united states canada the netherlands denmark france italy spain britain germany brunei and south korea as well as australia and switzerland which were added to the list on oct 26 managing director of koelnmesse singapore mr mathias kuepper said the promising news on the vtl expansion has resulted in an uptick in inquiries from exhibitors originating from vtl countries for one of its events next year while welcoming the expanded vtl scheme some industry players feel it is not enough on its own to help the sector recover from the impact of covid 19 other factors such as easing of domestic health restrictions and a clear road map need to fall into place before the sector is primed for full recovery they said ms sarah chew executive director of design and production company kingsmen exhibits does not expect a huge impact with the current list of vtl countries with international events in singapore previously we rely on asian regional attendees she said noting that many asian countries are not on the current vtl list for one thing domestic restrictions on the mice sector need to be eased said some industry players currently there can be up to 1 000 participants per session for mice events here if all are fully vaccinated but a bugbear for organisers is having to split participants into zones of 50 people each with no intermingling allowed mr dylan sharma vice president of advocacy and communications at the singapore association of convention exhibition organisers suppliers said the vtls are a huge leap forward in the safe reopening of mice events but what is equally important is a clear road map for the reopening he said while the increase in event capacity is a vital step it remains a far cry from what we hope to achieve which include among other things a liberalisation and lifting of current zoning requirements agreeing mr seth said a clear road map would go a long way as a large scale mice event can take a year or more from planning to execution making it vulnerable to sudden changes there must be consistent protocols so business owners can plan ahead confidently as a cancelled event can mean time and money lost the protocols with some already in place can help singapore stand out from other markets with inconsistent standards he added one example is the sg safeevent certification that venue operators and event organisers can attain if they uphold hygiene benchmarks the singapore tourism board has also developed a safe business events framework to help event organisers conduct events safely from implementing infection control measures to a plan for emergencies relating to covid 19 more than 160 mice events have been held under the framework before the pandemic the mice sector supported more than 34 000 direct and indirect jobs with a value add of 3 8 billion or 0 8 per cent of singapore's gross domestic product without further easing on capacity curbs and the shows allowed to be held the industry will continue to struggle said mr jean francois quentin chief executive of event management company constellar he said the current cost of organising events is prohibitive when you consider mandatory safe management measures exhibitors are also unlikely to participate with the limited number of attendees as they will not see a reasonable return on their investment at some mice events activities such as dinner parties after the event are an important part of networking vice president of informa markets in asia mr ian roberts said we have been working with the singapore government and they have been very helpful but there are still a lot of restrictions around dining out and meeting people the bloomberg new economy forum nef later this month was cast into the spotlight after groups of five including non nef delegates were allowed to dine together at nef venues and other designated restaurants the milken institute asia summit and the singapore international agri food week are among other high profile events taking place this month mr posch said the return of such events is encouraging given the risk in holding international events due to the uncertainty with singapore borders and meeting sizes he said i would caution to keep a long term view on the industry and judge success not just by events in the next few months but also by future bookings the capacity for mice events where fully vaccinated participants are mostly seated or standing at a fixed position is 1 000 per session and 500 if they are not seated and are moving around they must be split into zones of up to 50 people with no intermingling between the zones other restrictions include not having buffets for meals having safe distancing at all times and showing proof of a valid negative covid 19 test result

        "content": "singapore businesses that donate unsold and excess food should be exempted from liability if a recipient gets food poisoning as long as their contributions comply with safety and hygiene laws at the point of giving this is the view of over 80 per cent of more than 330 respondents in an online public consultation held between july 30 and sept 12 this year respondents also agree that both companies and charities should be given assistance including grants to buy refrigerated trucks and blast chillers to store and deliver edible and fresh food to the needy these are some key findings from the public consultation as part of nee soon grc mp louis ng's plans to propose a law that will help to reduce the nation's food waste problem he is hoping to introduce the good samaritan food donation bill through a private member's bill in parliament next year in september 2020 mr ng set up a committee to pursue the issue the team includes mps poh li san hany soh and edward chia as well as representatives from the food and beverage industry non governmental organisations and social enterprises if the proposed law is passed this means that as long as businesses abide by strict food safety codes for donated food they cannot be prosecuted or sued if someone who eats the food happens to get food poisoning said mr ng at a virtual press conference on wednesday nov 24 similarly 76 per cent of respondents agreed that the logistics providers for food donation charities should also not be held liable if they have followed safety and hygiene laws these liability waivers are crucial to make businesses and charities feel protected and spur more bakeries and restaurants to donate unsold items he added a lot of businesses are worried that they will get prosecuted if someone who eats their donated food gets food poisoning they're saying it's too risky to donate said mr ng who chairs the government parliamentary committee on sustainability and the environment he added that the proposed bill will include comprehensive food hygiene and safety codes by the singapore food agency for instance that businesses must follow before they donate only then will the liabilities be waived the restaurant association of singapore vice president dellen soh said no one intends to throw or waste food or get pleasure from it we all want to make the most of our food if there is a proper source to redistribute this wastage generally restaurants are supportive of the proposed law if all parties are being protected mr soh is also a member of the committee that is looking into the proposed law grand hyatt singapore executive sous chef steffan heerdt added hotels and restaurants would probably have challenges with timely and well organised logistics to ensure that the unsold food is repacked and handed off to a food charity in time to be safe for consumption when it reaches the beneficiaries the national environment agency currently has guidelines on donating excess food in its food waste minimisation guidebooks for restaurants supermarkets and food manufacturers the united states has a similar good samaritan law to help allay business concerns about liability when they donate food france was the first country to ban supermarkets from throwing away unsold food mr ng's committee is currently consulting with government agencies and ministries before preparing the first draft of the bill i don't want to introduce a piece of legislation that the government feels is impossible to enforce or to regulate this isn't a government bill it is a private member's bill he added once the first draft is done it will be put up for a second round of online public consultation before the first reading in parliament during the second reading there may be a debate on the proposed law the law that mr ng is working on will be his second private member's bill the first which proposed changes to an existing law to better protect native wildlife was passed as the wildlife act in parliament in march 2020 and that took almost three years of work in the online consultation 50 per cent of respondents said the proposed law should require food donation charities to be accredited respondents said this will raise credibility and increase public receptiveness to donated food mr ng noted that the 50 per cent assent indicates that the committee did not receive strong support for accreditation partly because accredited charities may need to meet additional criteria a lot of the charities rely on volunteers to deliver and handle the food there is the question of whether the volunteers have to go for courses and course duration he added the committee will continue to discuss with the charities about accreditation and polish the definition of being an accredited organisation major food donation charities such as food bank singapore and food from the heart are institutions of a public character ipcs or registered charities however other smaller scale or ground up food rescue organisations such as divert for 2nd life and fridge restock community sg are not classified as ipcs mr ng added that some of the restaurants he met with wanted the charities to be accredited so that they are assured that their food will be handled safely and will not get contaminated in the survey more than 60 per cent of the respondents agreed that businesses should be allowed to claim expenses as deductions against their revenue mr ng said some hoteliers also told me this might spur the hotels' senior management to donate food if there are tax exemptions

important criteria for a career these are not easy questions with standard answers for everyone but asking yourself a few questions may help point you to the best way forward be honest with yourself whether or not you're the only one who can do your job if you can be easily replaced you will not be paid very well if you remain in the same role if you want to stay in your current industry explore other roles that require more skills or competencies that increase your value to your organisation if you have been forced to switch to a new sector the transition will not be easy if you are struggling to adapt and wish to get back into your comfort zone ask yourself this is your former job likely to come back though and if yes when the supply of jobs like so many other things in an economy is decided by demand as long as demand for your product or service remains depressed your former job is unlikely to return rather than pine for the past try to make the most of the present

dragged on so in april last year the father of one decided to look for a new job a ccp to help mid career professionals switch to nursing caught his eye after all his father is a doctor and his late

no less the principal technician with st engineering was previously responsible for the maintenance and repairs for boeing 737 757 and a320 passenger aircraft as global passenger air traffic slowed while e commerce boomed under the global lockdown st engineering needed more maintenance personnel to support its growing passenger to freighter ptf aircraft conversion business mr veeragoo encouraged by his supervisor enrolled in a ccp in august last year to gain the know how for ptf conversion as well as lean management knowledge learning additional skills and regulation requirements was not easy but the ccp helped him build a foundation for continual learning and upskilling a job switch may mean an adjustment in our salary seniority and work conditions especially when you enter a new job or sector with limited or no work experience yet some job switchers may never grow into a role what then if you face hurdles in the role don't just give up speak to your supervisors or peers to get their

        "content": "singapore around one in three buyers of a housing board resale flat paid above market valuation this year an increase from one in five last year the increase came against the backdrop of steadily rising prices for such flats the median cash over valuation cov paid by buyers remained at 0 each year figures released by the ministry of national development mnd as part of a written parliamentary reply last monday july 5 showed but the proportion of buyers who paid a cov increased reflecting the current broad based demand for housing including in the private housing market supported by the low interest rate environment said mnd cov happens when a resale flat is sold above its actual hdb valuation and the difference can only be paid for in cash by the buyer if buyers and sellers have agreed on a resale price that is equal to the market valuation of the flat buyers do not have to pay a cov from january last year to april this year fewer than one in four resale flat buyers paid above market valuation for their flat said mnd in another written parliamentary reply last tuesday among these about six in 10 buyers paid a cov of not more than 20 000 while the remaining four paid more than 20 000 data from mnd showed in the 16 month period about 34 600 resale flats changed hands said ms christine sun senior vice president of research and analytics at orangetee tie citing hdb data this translated to about 8 600 buyers who paid a cov and among these around 3 400 paid more than 20 000 cov ms sun added whether 20 000 cov is high or low depends on the base price for a 1 million flat maybe it's reasonable for a 300 000 flat it's quite substantial we need more detailed data to properly gauge if the cov is considered high and how many people are impacted she said mr alan cheong head of research and consultancy at real estate firm savills concurs that more data on cov is needed to paint a full and accurate picture for instance the number of buyers who paid a cov may drastically increase if the time frame started from the third quarter of last year instead of the first quarter he noted this is because the resale market was still sleeping in january last year and resale prices started accelerating only in the third quarter of last year when singapore came out of a two month circuit breaker period in june 2020 said mr cheong hdb stopped publishing data on cov after 2013 mnd noted that hdb resale transactions are conducted on a willing buyer willing seller basis with prices negotiated and mutually agreed on between both parties in its reply last monday mnd said that the current proportion of buyers who paid a cov is significantly lower compared with the period between 2010 and 2013 then almost all hdb resale buyers paid a cov mnd added this is because the practice then was for sellers to obtain a valuation from hdb and negotiate a cov with the buyers to determine the resale price since 2014 the rules have changed currently both parties have to first agree on the resale price before obtaining a valuation from hdb which will determine the loan amount and cpf savings that can be used for the purchase should buyers choose not to proceed with the transaction after obtaining the valuation and asserting the cov payable they will have to forgo the option fee of between 1 to 1 000 paid to the seller dr sing tien foo director of the institute of real estate and urban studies at the national university of singapore said the cov rule change may have resulted in wider variations in pricing especially where there is keen competition on choice units buyers may overpay due to lack of reference point in terms of valuation information he noted era realty head of research and consultancy nicholas mak said the current bullish resale market naturally lends to a higher cov as demand for resale flats outstrip supply long construction delays plaguing build to order bto projects as well as increased numbers of returning overseas singaporeans and new permanent residents have driven up demand for resale flats he said as a result rising cov may price out those who are not cash rich mr mak added unfortunately the rising cov will continue to accelerate resale prices because the next round of valuation is based on transacted prices so it will push prices upwards as savills' mr cheong put it valuation is done based on past transactions but sellers look forward to projected prices so when the market starts rising sellers will ask for higher cov and buyers will anticipate paying more cov in june hdb resale prices rose for the 12th straight month with prices now just 1 7 per cent off their peak in april 2013 according to flash data from real estate portal srx released on july 8 analysts interviewed forecast that at the current trajectory hdb resale prices would likely reach a new record in the second half of this year unfortunately mr cheong said there was not much buyers and sellers could do besides to wait it out the government may intervene but that would be interfering with market forces and it comes with a lot of side effects so until the supply chain reverts to normal and the covid 19 induced

        "content": "singapore nearly one in three housing board blocks and 14 per cent of neighbourhoods today have reached ethnic quota limits underscoring the importance of having the ethnic integration policy eip in place to ensure social mixing said national development minister desmond lee the maxing out of racial quotas for flat ownership happens across all ethnic groups and in both mature and non mature estates he told the house on monday july 5 adding that the limits have persistently been reached in some areas such as bukit merah pasir ris and woodlands so just imagine how much more different ethnic groups would concentrate in different neighbourhoods if we did away with the eip and how much harder it would then become to promote mixing and understanding across ethnic groups in the home environment said mr lee introduced in 1989 the eip sets racial quotas on flat ownership within each hdb block and neighbourhood the policy remains relevant and necessary today amid changing household profiles mr lee said in response to ms cheryl chan east coast grc and mr chong kee hiong bishan toa payoh grc it serves an important function to ensure neighbourhoods remain inclusive and diverse as people get to interact with neighbours of different races almost every day along corridors void decks playgrounds and markets he added mr lee noted that some might argue that living next door to someone from a different race or religion does not mean people will learn to tolerate or understand differences others contend that social integration can be achieved in schools at work or during national service but the eip remains critical because so much of people's lives revolve around homes and neighbourhoods he noted if we don't live with one another it makes it much harder to empathise with other communities and understand the challenges they face and much easier to stereotype or assume the worst of those who are different from us this is a recipe for mutual mistrust and intolerance left entirely to social and market forces ethnic concentrations will start forming in different areas again he said this could be due to instinctive preferences to live near others from the same ethnic community or wanting to live near family members or specific amenities in some neighbourhoods mr lee noted individually these are completely understandable and reasonable preferences but collectively if we are not careful these tendencies could inadvertently lead to segregation among the races he said children for instance could grow up in neighbourhoods where they hardly see children of other races in their classrooms as most children go to pre schools and primary schools near their homes today interracial households can choose which ethnic quota to be considered under when buying a flat which is then fixed until they sell the flat to be fair to other flat owners said mr lee he also set out the historical context of the eip when singapore was still under the british rule the raffles town plan had designated separate geographical zones for each ethnic group which meant different races had little interaction in resolving to build a cohesive multiracial society the country's founding leaders did not blindly paper over differences between ethnic groups or take a melting pot approach by having different races blend or conform artificially to one uniform culture he noted instead the government decided to enlarge the common spaces through a range of policies such as allocating new flats to reflect ethnic mix of the general population but ethnic concentrations started to emerge in particular areas after resale transactions were allowed in 1971 mr lee said by the late 1980s chinese buyers were increasingly concentrated in ang mo kio and malay buyers in bedok and tampines we could see that without intervention there would once again be increasing concentrations along ethnic lines which would have separated us he said the eip was thus introduced in 1989 for both new and resale flats to ensure estates remain diverse mr lee pointed to how racial segregation is common and well advanced in some major european and american cities with wealthier ethnicities congregating in expensive gentrified precincts less well off ethnic groups are stigmatised and receive fewer opportunities and these differences get entrenched across generations he added citing a data visualisation tool developed by the university of virginia called the racial dot map which plots one dot for each person on the us map with different colours representing different ethnicities mr lee said the distinct patches of colour reflect a multicultural but segregated country drawing from these lessons he said singapore cannot leave social mixing to chance it is better to intervene upstream to pre empt the problem and to foster mutual understanding and encourage integration from the start he said if we wait until after racial tensions have developed and become entrenched it will become so much harder to heal those fractures and rebuild trust among different communities join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you

        "content": "singapore parents of younger children will soon be able to make bookings for them to get their covid 19 vaccine now that the pfizer biontech comirnaty vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 from the end of this month children from primary 3 to 5 will be able to get their first jabs with younger ones following suit early next year the vaccination exercise will involve more than 300 000 children paediatricians offer suggestions on how to prepare children for the vaccine a dr elizabeth tham consultant and head of the division of paediatric allergy immunology and rheumatology at national university hospital's khoo teck puat national university children's medical institute said children aged five and above are old enough to understand what is happening to their body and around them it is thus very important to help them prepare for vaccination at least a few days in advance if their parents choose to proceed with it giving children time to prepare and ask questions will help them feel less confused anxious and upset during the unfamiliar process so that it will be a smoother and less distressing experience for them and the family said dr tham as there are two vaccine doses a highly unpleasant or unexpected experience at the first dose may make it more difficult for the child to complete his or her second dose dr darryl lim a consultant paediatrician at kinder clinic in mount alvernia hospital said find out what their fears and thoughts are on the whole process and whether they might have had prior negative experiences in the hospital most primary school kids will understand why they're getting the vaccine which is to protect them to help their body fight off the virus and to keep them safe so they don't fall very sick he added give some time to the discussion and it shouldn't be when you're in a flustered state or when you're on the way to an event parents can also walk their child through the entire procedure from the vaccination to the observation period so they know what to expect it might be helpful to also watch videos or read a book on getting injections or role play using doctor's kits he said use child friendly language like you're going to feel a pinch or a poke he said and avoid words with negative connotations for instance you might not want to use phrases like 'you're going to get a shot' because to some kids 'shot' is like gunshot a dr cheng tai kin who runs kinder clinic at parkway east hospital said most children are reluctant to get injections and are scared of the pain some children will cry and may need an adult to be with them and comfort them he added dr lim suggests taking along some ice packs or a cool water bottle to numb the injection site you can tell them that it's going to be a smaller needle and if they're very fearful maybe they don't want to look at the needle and they can close their eyes parents can also let their children watch a video during the jab to distract them or take along books to read during the waiting time after dr tham suggested telling children that they had already gone through a similar process during their childhood immunisations even if they do not remember it parents can share their own vaccination experience with the child how their own body responded and how they managed the symptoms to show them it is something that many people have gone through and that it is safe she said she added that children should continue their daily routine on the vaccination day have a good meal and be well hydrated before the jab to avoid dizziness or fainting they may also choose to take along a small comfort object to the vaccination centre and to reward the child with a small treat after the vaccination to help them feel more comforted she said a dr cheng said parents should treat the vaccine as any other childhood immunisation there's nothing extraordinary about the injection itself it probably will be less painful than other vaccinations if the volume given is similar to the adult covid 19 vaccine dr tham said parents may choose to have their child vaccinated earlier in the day and schedule it so that they can look out for symptoms over the next two to three days immediate allergic reactions like anaphylaxis can usually be detected during the 30 minute observation period at the centre she added this presents as a combination of rashes swelling of eyes or face breathing difficulties low blood pressure or severe abdominal pain parents should monitor the child for the next 24 to 48 hours for delayed symptoms like fever muscle aches or lymph node swelling similar to what adults experience these side effects are similar to those for children's vaccines like the three in one vaccination against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis that primary 5 pupils undergo yearly dr tham said normal daily activities can be continued but children should avoid vigorous activities like physical fitness lessons sports enrichment classes for at least two weeks after each vaccine dose worrisome symptoms which warrant a doctor's consultation she added include persistent chest pain breathlessness or persistent fever that lasts beyond three days myopericarditis is very rare around three per 100 000 doses in individuals aged 30 years and below and its symptoms include persistent chest pain palpitations or an irregular heartbeat she said a experts said this is to ward off serious illness in the case of future surges of the virus dr cheng tai kin who runs kinder clinic at parkway east hospital said with the omicron variant and waves in infections the fear is that the base number of cases grows by a lot then you will have more children infected and as a result a corresponding higher number of them getting severe forms of covid 19 this means they would need hospitalisation oxygen supplementation and possibly intensive care dr cheng noted that when the number of community cases in singapore was low not many children were infected but as the figure grew in recent months so did the number of children getting covid 19 vaccination has not been rolled out for children under the age of 12 who accounted for 11 2 per cent of all cases on nov 19 in comparison the figure was only 6 7 per cent of all cases four weeks ago in october there have also been one or two cases of multi system inflammatory syndrome in children mis c every week in singapore since mid october with some cases requiring care in the intensive care unit mis c which affects a small minority of children afflicted with covid 19 is a condition where different body parts including the heart lungs kidney brain and eyes can become inflamed dr tham said the late effects like long covid in children are still unknown this refers to lingering symptoms like fatigue and chest pains weeks and months after infection high risk children with pre existing medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe covid 19 would also benefit from early vaccination she said vaccination also reduces the extent of transmission to adults elderly or vulnerable people around them who may be medically ineligible for vaccination senior minister of state for health janil puthucheary said last week that vaccination will keep children from becoming severely ill and reduce the risk of severe complications such as mis c a study of the pfizer vaccine conducted in the united states showed that it is 90 7 per cent effective in preventing symptomatic forms of covid 19 in children aged five to 11 in response to parents' concerns about the safety of the vaccine dr janil cited results from a study of the pfizer vaccine conducted in the united states that show the risks of adverse reactions are low in fact children aged five to 11 had fewer side effects compared with those aged between 16 and 25 the us centres for disease control and prevention cdc said last thursday it had received reports of eight cases of myocarditis in children aged five to 11 who received the vaccine there had been over seven million vaccine doses given in this age group at the time that the data was examined with 5 1 million first doses and two million second doses dr cheng said the data is too preliminary and needs to be analysed further it's too early to conclude we need to look at the baseline rate of myocarditis in this age group of children without vaccination eight cases from seven million doses is roughly one in a million that's 50 times lower than the 40 to 69 cases per million doses in male teenagers that was previously reported according to the cdc the reporting rates of myocarditis for boys aged 16 to 17 were about 69 cases per million second doses administered and around 40 cases per million second doses in boys aged 12 to 15 given that more than seven million children in the us israel and europe that have received at least their first dose of the vaccine dr tham said the real world safety data from their experience should be available very soon there have thus far been no reports that children in this age group experience higher adverse event rates than adolescents and adults other countries such as canada israel and australia have also given the green light for the use of the pfizer vaccine for children aged between five and 11 get the st smart parenting newsletter for expert advice visit the microsite

        "content": "today s early childhood education is facing unique challenges that are very different from the older generations with excessive use of technology and social media which can potentially aggravate anxiety and increase social pressure in a child from a young age according to the children s mental health division under the center for disease control and prevention in the united states 1 out of 6 children develop mental disorders in early childhood affecting how they learn behave or handle their emotions those without a diagnosis often receive medication treatment without accompanying psychosocial intervention so what does it take to raise a resilient child this question is especially relevant during the pandemic which has caused much disruption and stress for many people including children psychologists according to the american physiological association define resilience as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity trauma tragedy threats or significant sources of stress such as family and relationship problems serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors being resilient has a lot to do with having good social emotional skills such as self awareness social awareness self management relationship management and responsible decision making in addition a person's adversity quotient aq is especially important as the higher the person's aq level the more he is able to remain positive accept challenges and find creative problem solving skills in the face of adversity to be a highly capable productive and creative individual with that said oel holdings limited recently published social emotional development for toddlers level 1 a new textbook targeting children from 18 months to three years old it is the first in a series of four textbooks with level 4 suitable for children up to six years old the textbook aims to help children develop these skills as well as enhance personal effectiveness build positive relationships adapt to societal challenges in addition to strengthening their mental health and well being and avoiding unnecessary treatments via medication eso believes that for children to shine daily they need day to day support from parents teachers and society as a subsidiary under oel holdings limited an investment company with childcare wellness as one of its leading core businesses eso is an advocate of holistic education and a firm believer that children should acquire social and emotional skills from an early age to lay a good foundation for lifelong mental wellness the reason for publishing the textbook stems from eso s belief in spreading awareness on the importance of social emotional development following recent reports on childhood mental disorders and violence globally a global survey on programme for international student assessment pisa results from pisa 2018 by the organisation for economic co operation and development in 2018 indicated that globally 23 per cent of children had experienced school bullying or child violence in singapore the percentage is 26 1 out of 16 singaporeans also suffer from depression as reported by healthhub eso believes it can play a key role to help children thrive in these stressful times to achieve this it needs to engage parents teachers and the society at large to pay close attention to the social and emotional education of children oel s chief executive officer alice zhao xin adds we strongly believe that a child s actions can be positively or negatively influenced and childhood experiences can impact the individual s future this belief is supported by childhood psychologists and clinicians who have mentioned that the seeds for violence later in life may be shown in early childhood hence we think that efforts have to begin when a child is young and one way is to develop social and emotional growth in toddlers in order for them to become confident and resilient individuals the social emotional development for toddlers textbook which is authored by dr huang qiang with the editorial committee of chairman prof liu yunhua member miss zhao and senior advisor prof susanne ayers denham emeritus university professor of psychology at george mason university drew references from a research paper enhancing emotional vocabulary in young children by dr gail e joseph a professor in early learning at the university of washington college of education in the us the content is also based on the head start early learning outcomes framework from the us department of health and human services that advocates the skills behaviours and knowledge children should develop for school and long term success says ms zhao according to the research in the professional field of early childhood psychological education this is the first textbook in the contemporary era to systematically apply dr joseph s research results to the practice of early childhood education it also incorporates the two national level children s emotional development guidance frameworks and the research results of other talented early childhood education experts to meet the needs of children s social and emotional education and fill the gaps in the early childhood education resources parents play a big part in the social emotional development of their children but many are unaware of what to do and where to find the resources needed to get started they can now use this book at home to enhance what their child learns in preschool in the long run eso hopes to prevent or reduce child violence incidents increase social positive energy and have a more welcoming environment for people with mental illness ms zhao adds the social emotional development for toddlers level 1 textbook includes several recommendations for starters parents should try to commit 30 minutes a day over a regular five day period to engage their child to recognise and perform 16 emotions in various scenarios stated in the textbook this can be done through an activity chosen from five specific activities such as painting a face with emotion and guessing emotions from emotions cards it is recommended to let the child learn one emotional vocabulary word per week the textbook comes with 16 cards each focusing on one emotion after three weeks of learning parents should test the child on recognising and performing the word on the cards on the fourth week if the child is not successful repeat the three week regime avoid rushing through the process as the key to successful learning is to be consistent it is the norm for a toddler to take about a year to be able to recognise and perform the 16 emotions there is also a tutorial on how a child can seek help from adults during times of distress like when they are not able to get what they want a lesson plan is included to guide parents on how to use the textbook in addition to problem oriented teaching in story telling and role play activities to encourage children to learn remember and express emotions the textbook is recommended by various early childhood education experts and psychologists namely prof susanne a denham emeritus university professor of psychology from george mason university and member of american psychological association dr lynn wiener director of yale new haven hospital day care centers prof michael chia from nanyang technological university dr smita singh from james cook university singapore and dr weipeng yang from sr nathan school of human development oel and new haven hospital day care center dcc in the us have formed a

general elections a history of the people's action party 1985 2021 notes that the areas where the pap has put in some of the hardest yards delivering growth communication and party renewal are also areas that have proven to be some points of stress in recent years amid higher expectations from an affluent and educated populace it observes how having a reservoir of trust is integral to the straight talking that the party engages in when communicating with singaporeans the pap's attempts to improve people's lives and at the same time take hard policy decisions it says will increasingly have to be reconciled within this reservoir here are some of the key points from the book the 1984 general election saw a surprise 12 9 per cent vote swing against the party compared with the 1980 election the party's post mortem final report said the government had tempted fate through unpopular policies or policy suggestions such as raising the central provident fund withdrawal minimum age from 55 to 60 and the graduate mothers' scheme to develop more channels for citizen participation in policymaking the feedback unit was set up in 1985 then prime minister lee kuan yew and first deputy prime minister goh chok tong also spent much of the period addressing issues of the party's organisation vitality and spirit with the youth and women's wings set up to broaden the party base all education and social activities of the party were conducted through the pap community foundation pcf singaporeans were thus brought indirectly into contact with the party through pcf initiatives such as family days and bursary awards the idea of group representation constituencies grcs was publicly mooted in 1987 while this ensured that there would always be minorities represented in parliament some opposition figures saw it as an attempt to hobble the opposition given the logistical and recruitment challenges of fielding multi candidate teams town councils were a key theme at the 1988 hustings with the pap pointing out that residents would suffer if an mp with insufficient calibre to maintain the estate implying an opposition candidate was elected when the september 1988 polls came around the party secured a new mandate by winning 80 out of 81 seats with a vote share of 63 2 per cent the premiership passed from mr lee to mr goh in november 1990 with mr goh promising a more consultative style of governance three years later the party's vote share tumbled to 61 per cent from 63 2 per cent in 1988 and it lost three single member constituencies with then singapore democratic party sdp chief chiam see tong comfortably retaining his potong pasir seat the pap's internal post mortem noted that lower income groups were struggling and some among the chinese educated felt alienated after all vernacular schools were converted to the english medium by 1987 the party came around to a position that would have reverberations through the 1990s and beyond that those who supported the pap had to be rewarded in some way while those opposed to it had to pay some price the pap government realised that more had to be done to counter dissatisfaction on cost of living issues the cost review committee was announced in 1992 its 1993 report among other recommendations called for the timing of fee increases to be staged better a 1992 marine parade by election saw the pap roundly defeat the sdp but the sdp had kept the issues of growing elitism and rising costs alive setting the stage for a continuing debate in the 1990s on class divisions in society from 1992 the votes for upgrading strategy became fully crystallised while voters in opposition wards could not be denied the benefits of national programmes such as edusave and medifund the pap felt it made sense to serve the constituencies that voted for the programme first the party's victory at the 1997 general election was a resounding one with 65 per cent of the valid votes up from 61 per cent in 1991 its best showing since 1980 internal analysis showed that housing board upgrading may have tipped the balance in favour of the pap especially in areas where the flats were very old more generally the party's local government strategy which focused on municipal services and the availability of polyclinics and kindergartens also played a role the theme of unity and coherence as a bulwark against future challenges was developed in then pm goh's august 1997 national day rally speech where he explained the need for foreign talents as well as to re examine fundamentals the pap leadership was determined to maintain what it saw as the integrity of the political process even in the face of rapid technological developments at the december 2000 party conference then dpm lee hsien loong said the government had to manage debate actively and skilfully guide the debate without stifling it or letting wrong ideas take root in hindsight the 1990s was the last decade when the government was able to definitively control the discourse economic difficulties experienced not just by the poor but also by many in the middle classes were exacerbated by the downturns of 1998 and 2001 with the 9 11 attacks weighing on everyone's minds the polls were announced for november 2001 the widely felt need for certainty security and stability was evident in the party manifesto a people united secure future better life the 2001 election was the pap's largest renewal exercise since 1984 a total of 23 mps retired and 25 new candidates were introduced a diverse slate that had no singapore armed forces scholars and only two from the public sector the pap secured all but two of the 27 contested seats with 75 3 per cent of the valid votes but the upgrading carrot failed to shift mr low thia khiang of the workers' party wp in hougang and mr chiam in potong pasir and the book traces the decline of upgrading as an effective carrot to 2001 mr low also played another card the spectre of one party dominance by appealing to singaporeans not to give the pap a blank cheque at the party convention in 2003 the party's refreshed values honest multiracial meritocratic and self reliant were presented with a fair and just society at the heart of it the government faced dissatisfaction over aspects of planning and economic policy for example with the opening of the north east line bus services running along the same route were cut in july and august 2003 sparking anger among affected residents other controversial moves included raising the goods and services tax over 2003 and 2004 and upping the inflow of foreign talent permanent residency applications would eventually hit a peak in 2008 but the 2006 election delivered a satisfactory result with the pap taking 66 6 per cent of the popular vote this election was the first one where the internet truly mattered online discussions went beyond the allowed limits of political discussion set out in the relevant regulations while the top decile of households had over the first half of the decade seen appreciable income growth the bottom deciles saw negative income growth the price of public housing transport congestion rising healthcare costs and the influx of foreigners were other pain points the government moved to enhance support announcing in the 2007 budget the permanent workfare income supplement to replace the one off workfare bonus for low income workers and expanding comcare which was introduced in 2005 but public discontent boiled over in april 2007 when upward revisions to ministerial salaries came up for debate in the very same month when various mps pointed out that the increase in public assistance was not sufficient in the run up to the 2011 general election the public expressed the desire for a clean and smear free campaign partly fuelled by the apparent maturing of the opposition which could boast of candidates with strong academic and professional achievements the wp kept to its theme of a first world parliament with mr low the party chief then warning that if the wp bid failed in aljunied grc the opposition might be completely shut out of parliament a remark from then minister mentor lee kuan yew that if aljunied decides to go that way vote wp well aljunied has five years to live and repent sparked a public backlash the overall effect of social media was that issues such as the repent comment kept circulating even when the pap tried to move on on may 7 2011 the wp took aljunied with 54 7 per cent of the vote there the first time a grc had fallen into opposition hands the pap had suffered its most serious electoral reverse since 1984 one area where the government moved relatively quickly to relieve pressure was healthcare it also ramped up the building of new hdb flats and cooled the property market in august 2012 pm lee hsien loong announced the start of our singapore conversation a national dialogue whose scale dwarfed previous efforts there was also a rethinking of government communications for which an overall master plan did not exist before 2011 in august 2013 during a landmark national day rally speech pm lee announced a swathe of changes to expand social safety nets including the introduction of the pioneer generation package and the new universal medical insurance scheme medishield life to replace medishield the broader message was to bring about a new way forward for singapore with a more diverse and vocal populace contested political landscape and maturing economy these efforts had parallels in earlier history such as remaking singapore and refreshing pap over 2002 and 2003 but these were done from a position of strength after the pap's victory in the 2001 general election it is more apt to compare them with the national agenda or agenda for action initiative of 1985 to 1988 coming as they did after the 1984 general election reverse the pap's efforts policy and engagement wise were to pay off in the general election in september 2015 which it won with a resounding 69 9 per cent of the vote its best electoral showing since 2001 opposition missteps played into the result there had since 2014 been concerns raised over apparent lapses in accounting and governance at the wp run aljunied hougang punggol east town council but there was also the recognition that the election had been in many ways anomalous that year marked the 50th year of singapore's independence sg50 and founding prime minister lee kuan yew had died in march the party also upped its social media game with significant investments these included funds allocated to the development of the pap's mobile app website development and support as well as facebook ads and twitter engagement with the fading of sg50's afterglow and the covid 19 outbreak in 2020 the pap leadership perhaps in tacit recognition of the issues and anxieties that had been percolating on the ground gave little sense that it expected the july 2020 election to see a flight to safety of the type seen in 2001 also especially resonant was the wp's argument that the pap should not be handed a blank cheque two grcs and one smc lost to the opposition made for the worst result in terms of seats lost for the pap since independence in a surprise move the wp's mr pritam singh was offered the designation of leader of the opposition the book notes that many of the fixes that were needed after 2011 were policy moves but in 2020 there seemed to be stirrings of a different type of dissatisfaction ranging from a desire among voters for alternative voices in parliament to the friction and unhappiness that came with having to deal with the bureaucracy during the pandemic especially among individuals who in the course of their ordinary lives would have had little interaction with government agencies given the personal costs of the job inducting quality candidates into the party could become even more difficult in the years to come the pap will likely seek to be more inclusive

        "content": "singapore the people's action party is once again at a turning point as it navigates an ongoing leadership transition and a new generation of voters said prime minister lee hsien loong drawing parallels between now and 1985 when the party was passing the baton to its second generation leaders pm lee said there are many questions about the future including how the pap and its fourth generation team will deal with new challenges and whether they have what it takes to bring singapore forward in a speech on tuesday dec 14 at the launch of a book that chronicles the pap's history since 1985 held at the national university of singapore he said the next 35 years will be quite different from the last most fundamentally our task is not to foretell the future but to create it the pap continues to carry a heavy responsibility for singapore's security stability and success said pm lee who is pap secretary general it must always work closely with singaporeans to take the country forward the book titled a history of the people's action party 1985 2021 recounts the party's activities and events during that period it was written by dr shashi jayakumar a senior fellow and head of the centre of excellence for national security at the s rajaratnam school of international studies and published by nus press pm lee noted that the pap is now in the midst of a leadership transition from the 3g to the 4g team just like in 1985 when its second generation of leaders was taking over from the pioneer generation at the time only founding prime minister lee kuan yew mr s rajaratnam and mr e w barker remained in the new cabinet the pap's vote share fell sharply by 12 9 percentage points to 64 8 per cent in the 1984 general election which also heralded a generational change in the electorate said pm lee for the first time since independence the pap received less than 70 per cent of the overall votes at the post election conference mr lee kuan yew had said the older generation of voters who stuck with the pap through singapore's earlier years were beginning to fade away and were replaced with a younger generation that was better educated and more demanding of their leaders it seemed like the pap was losing its political dominance said pm lee on tuesday it was a moment for introspection perhaps even concern what did the future hold for the party and for singapore today pm lee is the only one of the 1984 batch of pap mps still in politics and the pioneer generation of voters who began to leave the scene in 1985 are mostly gone about 60 per cent of today's voters were born after independence he said growing up in a stable singapore they experienced steady progress and benefited from the nation's collective efforts to develop its economy as well as its identity their aspirations hopes and expectations are different from the young voters in the 1984 general election he said pm lee said that while the pap won a strong mandate in last year's general election the party's vote share fell by 8 6 percentage points to 61 2 per cent and it lost two group representation constituencies to the opposition for the first time he expressed hope that the new book will provide a sense of history and perspective to the pap's journey over the past decades and help its readers appreciate how singapore has achieved what it has while singaporeans who have lived through the past decades may not consider the country's stability progress and success astonishing pm lee said all this was hardly predicted much less foreordained it did not happen by itself nor has it happened in very many other countries and yet it happened in singapore he added how did singapore manage to achieve this the pap is an important part of the explanation this is why the party's history from 1985 to 2021 is a story well worth telling and understanding he said i hope this book will most importantly inspire the next generation party activists party leaders and singaporeans alike to be equally committed resourceful and resolute in pursuing a brighter future for singapore join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you read 3 articles and stand to win rewards spin the wheel now mci p 031 10 2021 mci p 032 10 2021 published by sph media limited co regn no 202120748h copyright 2021 sph media limited all rights reserved ",

        "content": "singapore workers' party chief pritam singh on friday dec 10 testified before a committee investigating a lie made in parliament by his former party member raeesah khan in a nine hour hearing that saw several testy exchanges between the leader of the opposition and minister for culture community and youth and second minister for law edwin tong among other statements mr singh denied directing ms khan to lie and said he told her to take ownership and responsibility of the issue mr singh also said wp leaders knew about the lie on aug 8 but took no steps until oct 3 to get her to correct her falsehood and that he saw no need to tell others in the party or the public that they knew about the matter early on as he felt it was not important to do so footage released by the committee of privileges on sunday dec 12 showed mr singh and mr tong both lawyers verbally sparring and things getting heated at various points over the chain of events around ms khan's untruth that led to her resignation from the party and as an mp for sengkang grc mr singh said more than a few times that he disagreed vehemently with positions put forth by mr tong who in turn repeatedly told the opposition leader to not play with words paraphrase his questions or speak over him one such exchange saw mr tong saying i think sometimes you give it away when you try to interrupt to which mr singh replied i'm only giving the truth away when mr tong said he would be the judge of that mr singh said i'm sure you will speaker of parliament tan chuan jin who chairs the committee and the only wp and opposition member on the panel dennis tan were the other members to ask questions of mr singh the committee also comprises minister for sustainability and the environment grace fu national development minister desmond lee senior minister of state for manpower and defence zaqy mohamad parliamentary secretary for health and communications and information rahayu mahzam and mp don wee here are six other testy moments that came up periodically during the nine hour session mr tong put forth that mr singh had said that regardless of whether ms khan's lie was brought up in parliament during an oct 4 sitting she should clarify the truth of her own accord to mr tong this meant that mr singh knew that the matter would be raised then which contradicted an earlier statement the wp chief made that because he was unsure whether the issue would come up he saw no need to inform the party central executive committee or review her draft statement you would have no doubt that either way this issue will come up in parliament mr tong said the two ways are either someone asks ms khan a question or if not then she would stand up on her own mr singh said not the latter reiterating that he had told ms khan to take responsibility and ownership if the issue came up and that mr tong had made a completely wrong interpretation of his position it's a clever try said mr singh you're trying to catch me in a gotcha moment i'm sorry mr tong you're a good lawyer but i'm a good listener when mr tong reiterated his point that mr singh had said ms khan would have told the truth of her own volition the wp chief said no that's not my evidence mr tong then said mr singh was changing his evidence because he had realised the bind he was in nice try mr tong that's all i'm saying mr singh replied you can't bind me with a piece of sewing thread because that's what it is the wp held a press conference on dec 2 two days after ms khan resigned on nov 30 this was the first time the public got to know that party leaders knew about ms khan's lie back in august mr singh said the press conference was organised to answer relevant questions that were going around they were going around because your nov 1 statement was less than open said mr tong referring to mr singh's facebook post in the wake of ms khan's admission the post said ms khan should not have lied in the house and that an mp's freedom of speech does not extend to communicating untruthful accounts it did not mention that ms khan had confessed about the untruth to him party chairman sylvia lim and vice chairman faisal manap on aug 8 disagreeing mr singh said it's a nice attempt for you to question what we put in our press statements it's an incorrect view there was nothing to hide and this idea of protecting myself my reputation sorry this is not what i entered politics for mr tong replied you may say that mr singh but you have not given us one credible reason why not to you mr singh interjected mr tong continued this material fact of your knowledge of the falsehood three months before it was disclosed in parliament why is that not in the statement well the only logical inference is that you wanted to distance yourself from the lie that ms khan had told and the fact that you knew about it and chose to do nothing about it so the reality mr singh is that you chose to take this out because you knew that it would put you in a bit of a pickle mr singh said this was completely incorrect but i must say a quite imaginative conclusion he added mr singh said that implicit in mr tong's questioning was that there was some cover up being attempted in relation to the wp leadership's behaviour once it knew of ms khan's lie because that was your line of questioning to the witnesses said mr singh referring to earlier testimonies before the committee by wp members i beg your pardon i don't mean to be argumentative he added mr tong replied i will be very upfront with you and tell you that i have got no agenda except to ask questions and work out what the facts are and there's nothing implicit in my questions it's direct he added if i'm going to make a suggestion to you i will do so and tell you so please don't read into my questions asked why ms khan could have lied in a text message to her aides where she said she had been told by party leaders to take the information to the grave mr singh said it was telling that ms khan had told a wp disciplinary panel that she suffers from the mental health condition of dissociation it was the first time i heard of it i asked her what dissociation was she said 'it's when i talk without thinking' said mr singh i asked her 'don't you think that's dangerous for an mp ' and she said 'yes' it may be helpful for this committee to call for some psychiatric report or evaluation on ms khan mr singh added that while her confession could be a lie in itself it might be helpful to mention this things do add up now as i hear what was said in the papers and what representation she gave and what she shared with the committee he said mr tong pointed out that mr singh had earlier said that nothing of ms khan's general performance as an mp was out of the ordinary he called mr singh's explanation and his suggestion that the committee evaluate ms khan's mental health quite inappropriate i'm not sure that the event that you mentioned on nov 29 is basis for us to call for a psychiatric assessment of ms khan mr tong said i think we know why you raised that suggestion mr tong said ms khan's lie was all the more serious as it had an adverse impact on the work of the police she had made up details about the police treating a sexual assault victim insensitively but mr singh disagreed with mr tong saying ms khan had not been able to substantiate her allegation to begin with the police is not some broken back organisation mr singh added i solemnly and sincerely believe if you speak to any senior police officer worth his salt he or she will tell you that in the course of investigations there can be a number of situations where certain questions are put to a witness which are uncomfortable for that person mr tong said that wrong had been done to the police as they had wasted time chasing their tails for three months to track down the case ms khan was talking about mr singh disagreed pointing out that the police could not find a case fitting her description this was revealed by the police on oct 20 so what work was actually done i am not aware i am not saying no work was done obviously work must have been done done to check said mr singh mr tong suggested that the police would have had to go through all its cases to check since the allegation made in parliament was serious and had to be addressed mr singh replied i do not believe i heard that from the police i did not hear anywhere that they've gone through all the cases after ms khan admitted her lie on nov 1 mr singh put up a facebook post which made no mention that ms khan had confessed about the untruth to party leaders on aug 8 mr tong said it was important for parliament and the public to know that the wp leadership was aware of ms khan's lie months back but mr singh disagreed what's wrong with being open and transparent honest give all the information mr tong asked in response mr singh said sure i agree with you that nothing is wrong with it why don't you do the same when tracetogether happened in late october why didn't the government just come out and tell the truth straight away don't wait for a parliamentary question in october 2020 minister in charge of the smart nation initiative vivian balakrishnan became aware of the possibility that data collected by the contact tracing tracetogether app could be accessed by police despite his earlier assurances that it would be used for covid 19 purposes only but it was minister of state for home affairs desmond tan who revealed this in january this year in response to a parliamentary question sparking a public outcry that led to dr balakrishnan apologising in february and saying he took full responsibility for the error mr tong said he thought mr singh might bring this episode up it's because it's very relevant said mr singh this is a decision the government made and a call the government made and this is the call i made mr tong said and i'm suggesting to you that this call you made was to suppress the information suppress the fact that you knew because you knew that it will cast you in a bad light mr singh said he completely disagreed join st's telegram channel here and get

        "content": "singapore significant resources were dedicated to investigating former workers' party mp raeesah khan's allegation in parliament about a sexual assault case the police said on monday dec 13 after she made the claim police officers went through two rounds of checking their records including all records of visitors to all police stations in the country since jan 1 2017 the aim was to identify the alleged visit said the police in a statement on monday evening dec 13 ms khan in a speech on aug 3 said she had accompanied a sexual assault victim to a police station but the victim later came out crying after being asked by the police about her dressing and whether she had been drinking she has since confessed to lying about the case and admitted that she had not accompanied the victim to the police station on friday workers' party chief and leader of the opposition pritam singh appearing before the committee of privileges said he felt the lie told by ms khan did not cause the police much harm he also questioned the amount of work put in by the police to investigate her allegations on monday the police said a substantial amount of resources was dedicated to this because it was a statement made by an mp in parliament and was taken seriously and at face value they added that their officers also considered the possibility that ms khan had accompanied a victim without entering a police station as such they also combed through more than 1 400 sexual assault and related cases from 2018 to 2021 and narrowed this list down to cases which appeared to somewhat match ms khan's description in parliament the police said the investigation officers in charge of these cases were all asked to check through their investigation records in detail other details were also checked with the officers police officers also checked through all the feedback received from members of the public in 2018 relating to sexual assault but could not link any feedback to the case mentioned by ms khan the police said they had dedicated significant resources to investigate into ms khan's claims and many police officers had been involved in the investigations into the false claims they added that the quantitative impact of such falsehoods is not just in terms of the man hours lost there were also delays in handling other matters and cases with impact on members of the public whose cases could have been handled faster had the time and resources not been wasted trying to investigate an incident which never happened according to a special report released on sunday mr singh in testimony to the committee of privileges said ms khan had not been able to substantiate the allegation he also disagreed that the false anecdote would have had an adverse impact on the work of the police he said the police is not some broken back organisation i solemnly and sincerely believe if you speak to any senior police officer worth his salt he or she will tell you that in the course of investigations there can be a number of situations where certain questions are put to a witness which are uncomfortable for that person culture community and youth minister edwin tong replied that a wrong was done to the police as time had been wasted by the police chasing their tails for three months in order to find the case ms khan was talking about mr singh disagreed he pointed out that minister of state for home affairs desmond tan said at the same session of parliament that the police could not find any case resembling what ms khan had described so what work was actually done i am not aware i am not saying no work was done obviously work must have been done done to check said mr singh when mr tong suggested that the police would have had to go through all its cases to check since the allegation made in parliament was serious and had to be addressed mr singh replied i do not believe i heard that from the police i did not hear anywhere that they've gone through all the cases in the statement on monday the police said public trust in the police force is integral to the officers' ability to carry out their mission effectively to ensure the safety and security of the people the statement said if the public whom we serve do not trust us it would be difficult to secure their cooperation which is often critical to prevent deter and detect crime and security incidents false accusations against the police also have an impact on victims' trust and confidence in the police and may deter victims from coming forward to seek help the police therefore take all allegations against our professionalism seriously when allegations are made we investigate carefully and if they are true we take steps to rectify the mistakes and minimise the possibility of them recurring it added that false anecdotes such as the one told by ms khan will cast doubt on and over time erode public trust in the police comments that downplay or dismiss the impact of false allegations against the police are discouraging they can also affect the morale of our officers who work hard every day to keep singaporeans safe and secure join st's telegram channel here and get the

        "content": "singapore relevance reasonable supposition level of culpability state of mind these are terms which to most singaporeans are incomprehensible legalese but the committee of privileges cop exchanges with workers' party wp vice chairman faisal manap last thursday dec 9 and wp chief pritam singh on friday were precisely about what logical conclusions and next steps they should have drawn from ms raeesah khan's lies in parliament the apportionment of responsibility to each of the leaders their state of mind when deciding how to engage her and what relevant information to divulge to their party members and the larger public early on in part a of the video recordings released on sunday as part of the third special report on the cop's ongoing proceedings mr singh was asked about the untruth that ms khan spoke in parliament on aug 3 in relation to the police shocked emojis popped up on my whatsapp when acquaintances watched the part of the video where mr singh denied that the police would be adversely impacted by former mp raeesah khan's lie that accused them of mishandling a rape victim's case that got me thinking most of us do not understand how adverse impact is legally determined how one's state of mind is legally assessed or how the degree of responsibility is legally weighed but all of us instinctively react to things in a certain way based on our values and principles so let's go back to first principles here are five things that stood out for me in mr faisal's evidence given to the cop last thursday he spoke of being overwhelmed by the revelations of ms khan's sexual assault when the three leaders and ms khan were at mr singh's house on aug 8 i get that their main concern was ms khan's well being but instead of discussing what to do about the lie it is said in the cop report that they tried to console and comfort her and the discussion moved on to what she had said in parliament about female genital cutting and polygamy we cannot judge what exactly went down in that meeting but let's say you are a boss and your employee admits to a wrongdoing how would you apportion the time spent in the meeting with her would you express sympathy for her personal situation and then take some time to work out how to deal with it according to the proper procedures or would you not speak further about the issue and jump to a discussion on tomorrow's assignment the report noted that after ms khan delivered her statement in parliament on nov 1 mr singh did not disclose in his facebook post that ms khan had confessed the lie to ms sylvia lim mr faisal and himself much earlier on aug 8 his explanation was that it was not important for parliament and not relevant for the public to know this here it is worth noting that the impact of the lie went beyond one person and had persisted for nearly three months for the sake of argument let's leave aside the impact on wp parliament and the police but what about other sexual assault survivors other women is this still irrelevant to the public then following his oct 3 meeting with ms khan mr singh did not inform the wp central executive committee cec that she might make a clarification in parliament the next day admitting that she had lied nor did he seek their approval or consensus there was also no draft of her statement prepared or any discussions or comments sought on a possible draft this is different from the approach taken to the nov 1 statement by ms khan in parliament there were several meetings to discuss the draft personal statement mr singh and ms lim gave comments to ms khan's draft statement even ms khan's father gave input on the draft and the wp cec was told on oct 29 and they reviewed her draft a host of explanations were given for this mr singh was not sure whether the matter would come up during the oct 4 sitting and if it did not come up then ms khan may not have clarified if the matter did not get raised then he had no plans to voluntarily get the issue clarified because it was ms khan's responsibility the question hanging over all this was whether she had told her parents about her sexual assault mr singh said in the context of this unanswered question my words to her was to take ownership and responsibility of the matter which extends to telling the truth culture community and youth minister edwin tong argued which in fact must fundamentally include telling the truth that's the whole raison d'etre behind making a clarification correct if the issue of ms khan's disclosure to her parents was so important why did mr singh not simply ask her about it especially if it was as the report also said in his mind a precondition before she clarified the truth in public mr singh said a party leader does not take an oath on behalf of all of his mps who take their oaths on their own standing and merit every wp mp is a leader they have to take responsibility if you honour the oath you've taken it is your prerogative to set the record right he added now put this side by side with what mr faisal said on dec 9 in an exchange between mr tong and mr faisal on ms khan's repetition of the lie on oct 4 and why he still did not ask mr singh what was going on given that the lie had remained on record for eight weeks then mr tong asked what is to stop you from asking mr singh what is happening mr faisal replied trust mr tong went on to say so you trust his judgment if that is the case why don't you leave everything to him the way you run your party the way you run your cec the way you run aljunied grc so here we have the vice chairman of the wp who repeatedly cites trust as the reason why he does not ask his leader what is being done even when something is amiss we also have a leader who according to the report said he had not directed former mp raeesah khan to lie but also took no steps for more than two months to get her to correct her false statement then we have ms khan herself who doesn't own up until a late stage even if we accept that this is the wp's modus operandi what does it say about the party's decision making processes and controls when individuals in any organisation do not own up to a material lie that has been repeated should people further along the chain of responsibility not actively take steps to resolve the problem in relation to the wp putting out a media statement on the formation of a disciplinary panel dp on nov 2 mr singh said that he did not think that it was relevant that he as the leader of wp and a member of the dp had been aware of ms khan's falsehood much earlier according to the report mr singh was asked if the suppression of the fact that ms khan had told some of the wp leaders on aug 8 and that mr singh had spoken with her on oct 3 would give the impression that it was all ms khan's doing he said that it was irrelevant to mention these facts in the two press statements the wp had put out the report also said that according to mr singh the involvement of himself ms lim and mr faisal in the events that unfolded would only become relevant if they could be shown to have directed ms khan to lie and no such direction to ms khan had been given now i'm not a lawyer but as someone trying to make sense of the technicalities of what is relevant or not why is the leaders' involvement only relevant if they could be shown to have directed ms khan to lie given that the larger issue is that they knew about the lie since august shouldn't the full facts of the case be presented so that the cec party members and the public can come to an unbiased and informed view in addition the dp comprised the very persons and crucially the only persons whom ms khan says had told her to continue with the lie again i'm not a lawyer but is there a potential issue of conflict of interest here take company boards for example which some of us may be more familiar with isn't it the case that board directors should not vote in respect of any arrangement where they have any personal material interest direct or indirect and even if the three leaders continued to be on the dp by virtue of their seniority and position in the party why were there not others on the panel who could also weigh in and if they were on the panel surely the full facts of the case should be made known to them too some singaporeans will understandably be upset by the temperature of the exchange especially the one with mr singh on dec 10 but as far as process is concerned the facts of the matter must be uncovered and probing questions must be asked it is not for us to make any judgment either way at this point nonetheless the past week has been a confusing one for many what is the difference between telling the truth and extends to telling the truth what is logical or illogical when is a conflict of interest not a conflict of interest where does trust end and credulity begin right now there do not seem to be unequivocally

        "content": "singapore some hospitals here have been setting up covid 19 virtual wards so that those whose conditions are stable but are ineligible for the home recovery programme will also be allowed to recover from the comfort of their homes these patients include those who are unvaccinated those on immunosuppressive medication and patients with chronic medical conditions the national university health system s nuhs virtual ward has helped more than 500 covid 19 patients so far saving 3 500 bed days since september last year said dr stephanie ko a consultant at the division of advanced internal medicine at the national university hospital s department of medicine the ward has also enrolled several omicron cases and it is prepared to help with bed capacity if the covid 19 surge hits she told the straits times on tuesday jan 4 the treatment in the virtual ward is similar to that in a covid 19 treatment facility or hospital with doctors and nurses doing ward rounds daily or every other day through teleconsultation and to ensure that the patients measure their vital signs routinely said dr ko the care team can also visit patients homes if required such as to administer drip based medication to help high risk covid 19 patients reduce their risk of developing severe pneumonia or to do blood tests in the covid 19 virtual ward our nurses teach patients how to monitor their own temperature oxygen levels and blood pressure patients with smartphones are enrolled into our vital signs chatbot which reminds them to take these readings and submit them via an online form up to three times daily she added for patients without smartphones they are loaned a tablet with bluetooth connected measurement devices so that they can take their readings which the virtual ward care team is able to view through a dashboard around half of our patients were referred from one of our cluster s three hospitals national university hospital alexandra hospital or ng teng fong general hospital after a period of hospital stay the other half were referred to us directly from community providers such as national university polyclinics or the case management task group at the ministry of health moh for patients who were at home and wished to continue recovery at home rather than go to a facility said dr ko such patients are either elderly 80 years old and above and fully vaccinated or more than 50 years old and not fully vaccinated have chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems such as patients who are on chemotherapy or have had organ transplants some patients dying from covid 19 but wished to do so at home have also been supported through the programme she noted similarly the singapore general hospital sgh which set up its covid 19 virtual ward on oct 8 has enrolled 120 patients so far said dr michelle tan the consultant in charge of the ward and the head and consultant at the hospital s department of family medicine and continuing care patients under this programme are monitored remotely with the help of a messaging bot known as doctor covid where they are required to report their vital signs such as oxygen saturation levels pulse rate and temperature three times a day said dr tan in a media interview on tuesday jan 4 some patients may be required to take their blood pressure as well and the necessary equipment can be loaned to those who need them she added those who are not tech savvy will have nurses call them regularly to check on their vital signs and to ensure that they are doing well at home dr tan said the bot co developed by sgh singhealth and the agency for science technology and research had initially been used in migrant worker dormitories during the peak of the outbreak there in april 2020 and has been repurposed for the virtual ward she noted currently two groups of patients qualify for the virtual ward those who have more complex medical conditions and are transferred from the hospital's covid 19 isolation ward and those who qualify for recovery at community treatment facilities but prefer to recover from home all patients must be at least 18 years old and can either be vaccinated or unvaccinated though those who are unvaccinated by choice will have to foot their own medical bills said dr tan one patient who has gone through the covid 19 virtual ward programme is caregiver kelly chavel who is on lifelong immunosuppressive medication after having received a heart transplant five years ago ms chavel 49 who is partially vaccinated said she tested positive for covid 19 on dec 5 and experienced mild symptoms throughout including sore throat running nose and cough after spending nine days in sgh's isolation ward i was discharged to isolate at home for another 11 days where i had to take my vital signs thrice daily the nurses would call regularly to check on me i felt very assured to have the medical team supporting me she added dr tan said patients who wish to recover from home instead of from a community treatment facility can do so under the programme after being assessed for their suitability since rolling out the virtual ward more than 800 bed days in the isolation ward have been saved freeing up capacity for more patients she added noting that singapore is bracing itself for a possible omicron wave in february or march dr tan felt that the virtual ward would play a very relevant role in such a scenario currently it has the capacity for 100 patients at a time though it has a surge capacity for up to 200 patients when needed she added through our experience of running the covid 19 virtual ward for the last few months i think we will definitely be able to expand our capacity to better support the situation and offset the patient load in

amid the spread of the new omicron covid 19 variant around the world the moves come as singapore works to assess the implications of the new covid 19 variant that has already spread to at least 16 countries after the variant was identified in south africa last week the ministry of health moh said on tuesday that no cases of omicron have been detected locally adding that the pre emptive measures will help to reduce the risk of importing the virus commenting on the moves during a press conference held by the multi ministry task force on covid 19 health minister ong ye kung said this is a prudent thing to do for now when we are faced with a major uncertainty singapore has just emerged from a stabilisation phase and has been relaxing social measures such as allowing more people to dine together in restaurants and hawker centres and also increasing group limits for gatherings while the current measures will not be dialed back for now the task force said it will hold off on further relaxation moh also said that anyone in singapore confirmed or suspected to be infected with the omicron variant will not be allowed to undergo home recovery and will have to be taken to the national centre for infectious diseases for isolation close contacts of these cases will undergo a 10 day quarantine at designated facilities and take polymerase chain reaction pcr tests at the start and end of their quarantine we are introducing a set of measures that serves as a strong yet reasonable response to the new variant to protect our local community said moh we will continue to monitor and evaluate data on the omicron variant as it emerges and adjust our border and domestic measures accordingly moh also announced the tightening of border measures that will take effect from 11 59pm on thursday first air travellers arriving on the quarantine free vaccinated travel lane vtl scheme will have to undergo supervised self administered antigen rapid tests arts at a quick test centre on day three and day seven of their arrival currently these travellers are allowed to enter without having to undergo quarantine under the scheme and have to take a covid 19 swab test only prior to their departure for singapore and after arrival here second all air travellers entering transferring or transiting through singapore must have tested negative in a pre departure test within two days of leaving for singapore currently travellers from hong kong macau china and taiwan are not required to take pre departure tests and need to take a covid 19 swab test only upon arrival these places are in category i of moh's risk classification framework which means they have the lowest risk of covid 19 infections third all travellers must take a covid 19 polymerase chain reaction pcr test on arrival this will affect non vtl travellers entering singapore who are not from hong kong macau china and taiwan currently they do not have to take a test upon arrival but have to be tested before the end of their stay home notice period travellers must self isolate at home in a hotel room or at a designated stay home notice facility depending on where they came from while waiting for their on arrival test result moh said that it will also conduct a one time pcr testing exercise for surveillance purposes for travellers who arrived in singapore between nov 12 and 27 and had been to the countries or regions affected by omicron in the 14 days before their arrival these travellers have been notified of their scheduled test time and venue said moh asking for the understanding and cooperation of affected travellers for the testing exercise meanwhile after the upcoming vtls with thailand cambodia fiji maldives sri lanka and turkey start around the middle of december no more vtls will be launched moh had also earlier announced that three other planned vtls for qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have been postponed indefinitely this is done as a precautionary measure to reduce the risks of importing the omicron variant to singapore said moh news of the omicron variant which is assessed by the world health organisation to have a very high global risk has in the past two days triggered japan and israel to announce plans to close their borders to foreigners the variant has many more mutations than the delta variant and has sparked concerns among health authorities worldwide though the impact of the mutations is still being investigated by scientists moh said singapore needs to buy time to learn more about the variant as some of the mutations found in the variant's genome previously found in other variants were known to enhance transmissibility and reduce vaccine efficacy in terms of vaccine efficacy early data suggests that current vaccines should remain effective against severe disease and death however more studies are needed to understand the actual impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures including vaccines and treatments moh added moh noted that there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of cases that are infected by the omicron variant in south africa it also said more countries have reported cases over the last few days suggesting that the variant has spread globally it added that singapore's community would have some protection against this new variant at the press conference on tuesday trade and industry minister gan kim yong who co chairs the covid 19 multi ministry task force said very little is known yet about this variant with regard to its transmissibility and severity and how effective vaccines are against it we are closely monitoring the situation and scientists around the world are working on it these tightened restrictions will be in place for four weeks they will be reviewed or extended if necessary said moh moh also said that from thursday it will go back to rostering weekly routine pcr tests for airport and other front line workers at the borders who may come into contact with travellers from places affected by the omicron variant this replaces the current routine art tests that such workers have to go through moh said a pcr based test will help detect not just covid 19 but the omicron variant in a timely manner aircrew serving flights from countries with omicron cases will be subjected to an on arrival pcr test and post arrival pcr tests on day three and day seven following each flight all other airport and border front line workers will continue with routine arts those who have recovered from a covid 19 infection will also have to undergo regular covid 19 testing as well moh said that as an added precaution those with a positive art result will have to go for a confirmatory pcr test correction note an earlier version of this story said six

covid 19 variant could force international borders to shut again the vaccinated travel lanes vtls for finland and sweden are also due to kick off as planned on monday news of the omicron variant which is assessed by the world health organisation to have a very high global risk has in the past two days triggered japan and italy to announce plans to close their borders to foreigners the republic's move to reopen to travellers from india and kuala lumpur is especially significant given that both were major markets for changi airport prior to the pandemic while indonesia was also a major market it has not reopened its borders to singapore yet under the vtl travellers vaccinated against covid 19 can enter singapore without having to serve quarantine they have to take designated flights into singapore among several other requirements a total of 29 designated vtl flights will land in changi airport on monday of this 10 are flights from new vtl destinations they comprise six flights from malaysia two flights from indonesia and two flights from india the first vtl flight from kuala lumpur jetstar asia's 3k684 touched down at changi airport at 10 02am on monday jetstar asia also operated the first vtl flight to malaysia with flight 3k683 departing for kuala lumpur with 170 passengers at about 7 20am the 180 seater airbus a320 aircraft landed at 8 19am a jetstar asia spokesman said the start of the vtl flights is an important milestone in the carrier's recovery from the pandemic she said the kuala lumpur singapore route has always been a critical route and the bilateral vtl agreement between both countries will help to restore one of the world's busiest international air links we are seeing strong demand for these vtl services highlighting the pent up demand of customers wanting to reconnect with family friends and colleagues she added meanwhile the first vtl flight to kuala lumpur by singapore airlines sia sq108 landed at 9 24am a spokesman said the flight touched down to a water cannon salute the return flight sq107 departed kuala lumpur at 10 25am and arrived in singapore at 11 35am this is an important milestone that supports the safe reopening of borders allowing families and loved ones to finally reunite and supporting the demand for both leisure and business travel said sia from monday sia will operate 10 weekly return vtl services between singapore and kuala lumpur this is in addition to 18 weekly return non vtl services between the two cities four other carriers scoot airasia malindo air and malaysia airlines will also operate vtl flights between both cities a director of a tech company who wanted to be known only as mr goh 40 was on board sq108 to kuala lumpur international airport the malaysian who was visiting his family in malaysia said he had no issues checking in and going through immigration at changi airport but he was frustrated by the long waiting times in kuala lumpur i paid for the one hour express polymerase chain reaction pcr covid 19 swab test but ended up waiting for two hours and 40 minutes said mr goh i was very frustrated they couldn't give us an answer and just kept asking us to wait the express service which costs rm370 119 was touted as being able to produce results in an hour compared with the standard pcr test which costs rm250 with results expected in three hours mr goh said passengers had to wait in the transit area of the airport after receiving a negative pcr test result he was then able to proceed to clear immigration he had to wait 45 minutes for his turn owing to long queues at immigration in total he said he took about four hours to leave the airport after touching down there are now 18 countries from which vaccinated travellers can enter singapore without quarantine following the launch of the new vtls on monday vtls for six other countries thailand cambodia fiji maldives sri lanka and turkey will start around the middle of december but three other planned vtls for qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have been postponed indefinitely as a precautionary measure to reduce the risks of importing the omicron variant to singapore the variant which has many more mutations than the delta covid 19 variant has sparked concerns among health authorities worldwide sia said in a facebook post on monday that it will no longer operate designated vtl flights from dubai following news of the deferred vtl with uae sia and scoot have also canned plans to operate vtl services from phuket and chiang mai respectively due to regulatory reasons mr mayur patel head of asia at flight data and analytics provider oag aviation said worries about the potential threat of the omicron variant will likely limit the impact of the new vtls he noted that the regional vtls for kuala lumpur indonesia and india may continue to see demand from domestic workers as well as visiting friends and relatives but with the new variant and increases in cases in europe i do not anticipate significant traffic materialising as travellers calibrate risks from the new strain from long haul markets said mr patel some regional markets such as japan are already shutting their

to be stacked against you for two home grown brands it's all the elements of a tale as old as time good old fashioned love and an enduring faith in the stories they tell through their products in the 1970s young scientist dr lee kum tatt fuelled by his desire to fulfil a promise to immortalise orchids for his wife discovered a way to encapsulate natural orchids in gold that would later become the iconic symbol of local jewellery and lifestyle brand risis at the brand's initial launch at ck tang in 1976 3 000 gold plated orchids were sold out within a few mornings thus planting the seed from which risis' business would flourish over the next three decades similarly the beginning of perfume brand scent by six can be traced back to the day founder jason lee proposed to his girlfriend with the first perfume he created this scent which had hints of green tea and lavender as an homage to their holidays in hokkaido along with a second one were also gifted to their wedding guests and the positive reception gave him the confidence to give up a promising career at one of the world's largest fragrance companies and start his own business the compelling origins of these two brands have propelled them into an indelible part of local history risis and scent by six are two of the 64 brands newly recognised under the made with passion initiative that was launched in november 2020 by the singapore brand office and singapore tourism board and supported by enterprise singapore the initiative aims to promote consumer awareness and drive support for local brands that are strong representations of singapore's diverse lifestyle sector across the four lifestyle categories of beauty wellness fashion accessories homeware d cor and packaged f b through this made with passion also hopes to inspire brand owners and singaporeans to pursue their dreams with passion and enable collaboration opportunities among the brands to encourage further product innovation a total of 111 brands has since been recognised under the initiative while passion might have given the initial spark for the inception of risis and scent by six it's the commitment to quality control and constant innovation that have sustained them as iconic home grown brands with quality products and helped them earn the made with passion recognition at the heart of risis' highly recognisable jewellery and lifestyle pieces is a painstaking manufacturing process to immortalise the precious orchids at best bloom this means picking fresh orchids in a climate controlled facility selecting only the fullest orchids with delicate forms preserving these exquisite flowers in a fine layer of copper before the piece de resistance the process of 24k gold plating which dusts the orchid in a shimmery gold hue it's a labour intensive but critical part of risis' brand identity a special technique that it applies to the preservation of other organic material like roses ferns seeds and foliage to create items like brooches earrings necklaces and other ornaments the ultimate test of longevity for a brand however is its ability to stand up to challenges so as to deliver a consistently good product whilst staying true to the made with passion ethos of maintaining a good reputation and having a loyal customer following at the onset of the pandemic ms verene ng chief executive officer of risis had to steer the company through supply chain challenges whilst embarking on a rebranding exercise to market risis towards a younger generation to breathe new life to the orchid designs risis collaborated with four local fashion designers including one from a brand recognised under the made with passion initiative and plans to release the new product lines in the first quarter of 2022 work to further improve the user experience on its e commerce platform to time it with the rebranding exercise is also currently underway for scent by six the challenge stems from finding a way to stand out in a crowded marketplace dominated by european perfume brands to do this mr lee's set of six perfumes uses the main ingredients in each perfume to highlight the stories and inspirations behind each variant in this manner it invites the user on a journey of self discovery and exploration for example the hikaru scent co created with beneficiaries from the singapore association of mental health has fresh japanese yuzu as one of its top notes a key ingredient that mr lee says is instrumental to evoking feelings of happiness and joy it's also a tribute to the scent's co creators in japanese hikaru means to shine something that mr lee hopes the scent has afforded the co creators amidst a tough 2020 in the early days of the business to make headway in the retail space as a new local perfume brand mr lee spent hours at flea markets to give out samples of his perfumes and participating in larger scale fairs like boutique fairs to hobnob with industry players like hotels airlines and departmental stores he caught his first break after the spa director of equarius hotel discovered scent by six at tangs and invited him to curate a scent for the hotel more recently in a landmark achievement for the brand scent by six collaborated with singapore airlines to create a unique signature scent for the airline that included floral notes from flowers depicted in sia's new batik motif by constantly refining their processes and innovating their products risis and scent by six are able to deliver quality products recognised by most singaporeans and it is thus befitting that they are now earned the made with passion accolade as the made with passion tagline you know it's good when it's made with passion goes the enduring quality of risis and scent by six is testament to the ambition

        "content": "singapore the latest month long extension of covid 19 restrictions following round after round of tightened curbs this year could sound the death knell for many businesses said retailers and retail associations singapore's front line business community is in deep despair and disrepair said the singapore tenants united for fairness sgtuff group in a facebook post on wednesday oct 20 the group was responding to the government's announcement earlier on wednesday that covid 19 restrictions such as capping group sizes for social gatherings and dining in at two people will be extended until nov 21 the extension comes as the healthcare system is at risk of being overwhelmed on wednesday there were 3 862 new covid 19 infections and 18 deaths from complications linked to the virus in the statement on facebook sgtuff said the extension will sink the boat for many of us who have been barely hanging on just this year alone we have been badly hit by four waves of restrictions of increasing severity and negative impact to traffic and business said the statement it added that the vast majority of business owners will still have to dig deeper into whatever they have left in their own pockets to be able to pay for staff salaries rentals and many other overheads the executive director of singapore retailers association ms rose tong echoed the group's sentiments saying the retail sector is already in dire straits and the latest announcement is going to sound the death knell for so many businesses more retailers will be decimated and we anticipate potential job losses on wednesday the health ministry also announced that the government will offer wage support of 25 per cent under the extended jobs support scheme jss for sectors that are significantly affected by the continuing curbs these include businesses in the food and beverage retail and gym and fitness sectors we are grateful for handouts but that's not what retailers are looking for we want to be able to do business said ms tong adding that footfall has dropped drastically with every round of restrictions and safe management measures sgtuff called for urgent help in several areas such as rental subsidies for four weeks higher wage support of 50 per cent under the jss instead of the current 25 per cent and moratoriums on existing bank loans the group also noted that the recent opening of vaccinated travel lanes to overseas destinations means we are now seeing more business outflow due to locals travelling abroad than inflow from foreign tourists it added that this would be further compounded by the planned hike of goods and services tax gst from the current 7 per cent to 9 per cent over the next 12 months front line businesses will be further hit by the likely increase of gst to 9 per cent further inflation of business costs and increased wage costs due to the implementation of the progressive wage model the group said however mr kurt wee president of the association of small and medium enterprises had more immediate concerns mr wee hopes the government can reassess some restrictions such as allowing those in a family unit of five or six to dine together instead of being separated because of the two person cap the business community's high level of confidence in the government's covid 19 strategy remains he said adding that it is committed to coordinating with the government but we hope that more front line businesses can have greater breathing room he was also encouraged that the multi ministry task force handling covid 19 said the measures will be reviewed at the two week mark and adjusted based on the virus situation in the community then we remain committed to give active feedback to the government and hope it can calibrate the response and is prepared to relax measures in one or two weeks' time he said retailers however are at a loss as to how to move forward with each round of tightened measures we see footfall plummeting along with sales said ms gin lee founder and designer of home grown fashion label ginlee studio the label has outlets in raffles city shopping centre great world and tangs it's not just the reduced footfall it's also the drop in shoppers' confidence they have no events to go to and there's less need to buy new clothes said ms lee it's been disappointing i don't know what else i can do to make a difference gyms and fitness studios too were frustrated by the extension of restrictions but several remain optimistic classes at f45 training aljunied currently allow 12 to 15 people at a time with a 3m distance between groups of two this is down from the 20 to 24 people allowed earlier this year owner ben adams said getting more members in would allow us to recover some revenue and survive as a business but we keep on playing by the rules and we're positive that the future is going to improve another gym body fit training raffles opened only in july this year its owner mr ryan choo said opening a gym in this environment has been challenging but you just have to push through and find ways to keep the members and ourselves engaged he said our mindset now is not to expect too much because you never know what's going to happen experts such as mr guillaume sachet partner at kpmg in singapore said that the pandemic is a long drawn affair and disruptions and closures are expected to happen consistently singapore's retail and tourism sectors need to have made some clear decisions to pivot to other business models and diversify their channels and customer base said mr sachet citing industries such as the meetings incentives conventions and exhibitions sector which has moved into digital exhibitions to continue to engage the business community globally otherwise it is

which are now recognised with the made with passion mark this is a marketing initiative of the singapore brand office and singapore tourism board supported by enterprise singapore that encourages everyone to support local lifestyle brands for their signature kueh chang and ice cream cookies made with passion highlights home grown brands that have built an enduring and also endearing reputation

this both companies have expanded their product lines the former now also offers pineapple tarts and pandan love letters while the latter sells award winning vegan ice cream the values of

kitchens and two stores the one along east coast road sells kueh chang and nyonya kueh cookies and snacks it also has a singapore visitor centre that pays tribute to the rich peranakan heritage of the neighbouring katong enclave as well as a boutique selling peranakan clothing and accessories including batik face mask and porcelain homeware the other is in joo chiat place and sells kueh chang and other bestselling food treats the recipe for the famous rice dumplings is still the same one mdm lee used 76 years ago the family buys the spices and other ingredients from the sources mdm lee used

improve the techniques now a compressor cooker cooks 800 dumplings in one hour instead of the usual two hours needed to cook 400 the process of producing kueh chang however cannot be fully automated

the right thing and our perseverance is paying off we want to preserve our grandmother's legacy family is also a great inspiration and motivator for ms chiam's business when her then boyfriend now husband couldn't find the ice cream cookies he used to eat in the us here she started the ice cream cookie co at home with only three flavours she currently offers nine cookie sandwich flavours and 18 pint flavours in 2017 hers was one of the first singaporean companies to launch a vegan ice cream range also inspired by her husband who suffers from egg and dairy allergies personal needs have always inspired our r d process says the mother of two who has since also launched a low sugar egg free line of muffins brownies and cookies as her son is allergic to eggs however the road to success wasn't smooth at first even though serving ice cream cookies to customers at a farmers market was easy distributing the same products to cafes and restaurants meant stepping up her game ice cream is highly scientific despite its appearance not all artisanal products make excellent packaged products i couldn't control when and how someone consumed my goods the hardness of the ice cream was also beyond my control because of that i became more serious about r d there is also the ongoing process of creating new flavours like vegan dark chocolate and onde onde to continue enticing existing and new customers even the simplest such as vanilla or chocolate undergo up to about 20 trials because they are very pure tasting and require the right mix of ingredients trickier flavours include bubble milk tea gelato which requires a certain level of scientific finesse as the mochi bubbles must remain soft and chewy even after the ice cream has been frozen explains ms chiam our customers can taste the effort that goes into our products to date her proudest moments include having her brand served in singapore airlines' first class cabins following that ms chiam did not anticipate the covid 19 pandemic and the 2020 circuit breaker period her wholesale business dwindled to almost zero when restaurants and cafes temporarily closed thankfully our do er attitude has made a difference we just rolled up our sleeves and got to work a product is one thing but the people make the company and no task is too small or beneath us fortunately the ice cream cookie co saw a significant increase in supermarket and online sales during the circuit breaker its website received up to 400 orders every day with customers telling the team on its instagram account that the ice cream was a great reward for those stuck at home after a long day of zoom meetings ms chiam knows however that success doesn't just end here next year her company will move into a new factory to improve operational standards and she is constantly motivating her r d team to come up with new flavours made with passion couldn't have come at a better time for her it shines a light on small and medium sized enterprises with

road to have one making the announcement on monday nov 15 national development minister desmond lee said the new system will allow the authorities to test it in different road conditions old upper thomson is a one way road while rifle range road is two way mr lee also announced two studies on the public's perception of wildlife to begin next year and gave an update on a campaign by the jane goodall institute singapore to stop people from feeding monkeys he was speaking at a virtual dialogue organised by the institute where he conversed with dr goodall about living with wildlife the session was hosted by nature society singapore president dr shawn lum dr goodall is a world famous primatologist known for her work on chimpanzees in tanzania where she immersed herself in their habitat observing them closely highlighting singapore's science based approach to wildlife management mr lee said the national parks board nparks will broaden its species recovery efforts with 160 species set to come under such efforts in 2030 that is up from 120 today in a statement nparks said the new animal detection system will be deployed at rifle range road as animals have been seen crossing it to get between two forested areas bukit timah nature reserve and the upcoming rifle range nature park the system will complement other efforts by nparks to provide safe connectivity for wildlife in rifle range road such as canopy rope bridges and culverts plans for the new system follow a similar initiative by nparks and the land transport authority in october 2019 then the animal detection system was deployed in old upper thomson road to assess the reliability of the system in detecting wildlife movements and alerting oncoming road users to reduce the speed of their vehicles the system works by using closed circuit television cameras that are equipped with analytics technology to detect animals and reduce the odds of false triggers upon animal detection led signs are lit to alert motorist of the animals' presence nparks said that the system in old upper thomson road has shown an accuracy rate of close to 100 per cent and that a number of motorists have been observed slowing down upon seeing the lighted sign it noted that motorists generally travel at slower speeds along the stretch as it is a single lane road with many bends mr lee also announced on monday that two nationwide studies will be conducted next year to gather public perceptions on wildlife their findings will guide the development of strategies that manage human wildlife encounters the first study a survey by jane goodall institute singapore will collate public sentiments toward primates in singapore and macaque management measures the minister said such measures include monkey guarding a wildlife management technique that aims to deter macaques from negative behaviours such as foraging for human food within residential areas monkey guards wave sticks and make loud noises to guide macaques safely away from residential areas and back to the forest edge deterring them from relying on man made food sources this survey will begin early next year and its results will guide the second study a broader and more in depth study by nparks and the singapore university for technology and design's lee kuan yew centre for innovative cities the study by nparks and the university aims to understand the public's perceptions and experiences regarding wildlife it will also shed light on how human wildlife encounters are experienced here as being positive or negative intentional or non intentional all common species of urban wildlife in singapore will be included in the study which will comprise both quantitative and qualitative assessments such as surveys and interviews it will begin in early 2022 and be completed by mid 2023 findings will be used to encourage sustainable and positive human wildlife relationships said nparks meanwhile mr lee announced updates to the institute's no feeding campaign which was launched in november 2019 and aims to stop public feeding of long tailed macaques the campaign organised with several other wildlife groups also seeks to educate the public on what to do during wildlife encounters and encourage coexistence of humans and animals the institute said that thus far the campaign has reached more than 24 000 people through 152 outreach opportunities by itself the animal concerns research and education society acres and nparks these include talks events and site visits in addition 340 monkey guards from various groups were trained including staff and volunteers of organisations such as mandai wildlife group and sentosa development corporation monkey proof bins have also been installed across the island 26 in areas

specified period of time and does not respond to calls the lions befrienders will alert his next of kin or neighbour or send a staff member to check on him the i ok lb system which goes to the senior in the form of a tablet is the brainchild of the lions befrienders a charity that serves seniors through befriending active ageing centres and home personal care services among other services its chairman mr anthony tay does not want any of the seniors it serves to die an undignified death where they die alone and no one discovers the body until much later executive director karen wee said the motivation behind this system is to address the seniors' fear of dying an undignified death or that no one comes to their rescue when they need help we want to let them know that we are there with them the charity plans to give at least 2 000 to 3 000 tablets to the seniors it serves from next month these elderly beneficiaries live in highly subsidised rental flats and most of them live alone the customised tablet costs about 400 and the i ok lb system was developed by weeswares at a highly discounted rate for the charity said ms wee the project's sponsors include the infocomm media development authority and the temasek trust the problem of undignified deaths is getting more pressing in a rapidly ageing society as a growing number of seniors live alone in 2020 21 6 per cent of household reference people aged 65 and older lived alone up from 17 4 per cent in 2010 the population trends 2021 report defines a household reference person as the oldest member of the family its main income earner the house's owner occupier the person who manages the household affairs or the person who gives information pertaining to other family members the report is published by the department of statistics on sunday dec 26 a 63 year old man was found dead in his toa payoh flat after his neighbours detected a foul stench emanating from the unit in september a woman 74 was found dead in her bedok north flat when concerned neighbours opened her unlocked door after not seeing her for some time so with the i ok lb system the tablet serves multiple functions besides its key function of checking if the senior is well and alive it can remind the senior to take his medicine through the tablet lions befrienders staff can send messages to seniors or video call them and seniors can have tele consultations with a doctor and for those who are not literate the tablet will read out the messages in a language or dialect of their choice the idea of the i ok lb system to keep tabs on seniors came after the circuit breaker period in april to june 1 last year when all non essential activities came to a halt during the circuit breaker the centres the charity run for the elderly were closed and staff and volunteers could not visit vulnerable seniors in their homes to check on them unless they needed urgent help more than 30 senior citizens took part in the tablet's trial earlier this year and most said they found it useful for example befriender executive chua hsiu mei was alerted one day when a frail man in his 70s did not press the button on his tablet she went to his flat and found that he had fallen at home the fall was not serious and he later saw a doctor mr keith tan an innovation executive at lions befriender said they senior citizens said they feel safer as someone is monitoring them many of them don't fear death but they are all afraid that no one discovers their body after they die beset by a host of serious health problems mr gunasekar arumugam 63 knows he could die any time but he fears an undignified death he has suffered a stroke and has kidney failure and ischemic heart disease among other illnesses mr arumugam who lives alone in a two room rental flat said anything can happen any time there are people who died and after two or three days there is a smell and people called the police i don't want that he feels more at ease as he has a tablet given to him by the charity lions befrienders knowing that someone is checking on him each morning after he wakes up he presses a button on the tablet to signal he is still alive he does the same thing at night there was only once when he forgot to do so in the three months or so he has the tablet that was when his brother died lions befrienders' staff called his next of kin who told them he was at his brother's wake through the tablet the charity's staff send him messages to check on him and they do video calls with him too mr arumugam is part of the trial of the i ok lb system where the lions befrienders gave more than 30 seniors a customised tablet he is separated from his wife and has three sons he used to work as a courier but he said he had to stop after his stroke about two years ago while he can still walk he uses a motorised wheelchair to get around when he goes out he said this tablet is very helpful i feel safe knowing that if anything happens to me
